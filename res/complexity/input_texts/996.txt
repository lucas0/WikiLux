Califia \( probably from Arabic Caliph , which was understood by Europeans to mean king ruler \) is a legendary Amazon warrior queen , associated with the mythical Island of California The US state of California , as well as the Mexican states of Baja California and Baja California Sur , are thought by some to be named after the queen \( see Origin of the name California \) The legend of Queen Califia is related to the legendary Hajj of Mansa Musa to Mecca in 1324 According to Al Omari 's chronicle of the event , he took 60 , 000 courtiers and servants , richly dressed , and 80 camels each carrying some 300 pounds of gold Wherever his train halted on a Friday , he paid for the erection of a mosque Everywhere he went , he became legendary for his generosity and the extravagant spending In today 's economy he distributed almost 1 2 a billion dollars worth of gold throughout North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula They spent so much gold it lowered the price of gold in Egypt for the next 10 years The Hajj of Mansa Musa and his entourage created waves throughout the Muslim world , which at that time included the Iberian Peninsula , then known as Al Andalus , or Andalusia \( Spain \) , hundreds of years afterwards One of the most prominent aspects of the legend involved female warriors in his entourage Two hundred years later the Spanish writer Garci Rodr guez de Montalvo wrote a novel entitled Las sergas de Esplandi n \( The Adventures of Esplandi n \) , written around 1510 This novel tells the story of a Black queen who ruled the island of Califia , where the primary mineral was gold and Black women warriors ruled As the legend goes , Know that on the right hand from the Indies exists an island called California very close to a side of the Earthly Paradise and it was populated by black women , without any man existing there , because they lived in the way of the Amazons They had beautiful and robust bodies , and were brave and very strong Their island was the strongest of the World , with its cliffs and rocky shores Their weapons were golden and so were the harnesses of the wild beasts that they were accustomed to domesticate and ride , because there was no other metal in the island than gold The legend was so well known that Hernando Cortez , the explorer , requested resources from the Spanish monarch to go in search of the legendary land of Califia and , in fact , thought he found the land off the west coast of New Spain This legend , known throughout Europe , also influenced a number of other explorers including Columbus himself , as evidenced in his diary The Indians told him that along that route he would find the island of Matinino , which they said was populated by women without men , to which the admiral replied he wanted very much to bring five or six of them to the king and queen but they said that it was certain that they the women existed and that at a certain time of the year men came to them women from the aforementioned island of Carib , which they said was ten or twelve leagues away , and if they gave birth to a son they sent it to the island of the men , and if a girl , they kept her with them Thus , the hunger for wealth , riches and gold for personal gain , as well as tribute to their royal sponsors merged with the legend of Mansa Musa 's female warriors and took on a life of its own and precipitated the Spanish hunt for gold in North America In 1536 when the explorer Hern n Cort s landed with his crew in what is known today as Baja California , they believed that they had arrived in Califia 's land A portion of the original of this document Las sergas de Esplandi n was translated by Edward Everett Hale for The Antiquarian Society , and the story was printed in the Atlantic Monthly magazine in 1864 By 1770 , the entire Pacific coast controlled by Spain had been given the name California , and the Spanish speaking people who lived there were called Californios Queen Califia reemerges in 1924 at
