The Center for Mathematics and Theoretical Physics \( CMTP \) is an Italian institution supporting research in mathematics and theoretical physics The CMTP was founded on November 17 , 2009 as an interdepartmental research center of the three Roman universities Sapienza , Tor Vergata and Roma Tre The CMTP 's director is Roberto Longo , from the Mathematics Department of Tor Vergata University , and its scientific secretaries are Alberto De Sole , from Sapienza University , and Alessandro Giuliani , from Roma Tre University The center does not have a permanent location however , it is temporarily hosted in Tor Vergata 's Mathematics Department The aim of the CMTP , according to its Web site , is to take advantage of the high quality and wide spectrum of research in mathematical physics presently carried on in Roma sic in order to promote cross fertilization of mathematics and theoretical physics at the highest level by fostering creative interactions of leading experts from both subjects Activities of the center The CMTP promotes scientific research by organizing workshops , congresses , and periods of thematic research sending invitations to scientists and assigning study grants The CMTP 's goal is to attract foreign scientists of international prestige and young talented foreigners to Rome by offering a natural place for scientific education and a base of cultural interchange with other scientific centers abroad The opening activity of the center was to present the Seminal Interactions between Mathematics and Physics conference hosted by the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in Rome The invited speakers counted , among others , four fields medalists Alain Connes , Andrei Okounkov , Stanislav Smirnov and C Villani and an Abel prize winner , Isadore Singer As part of the conference , the center organized two evening public lectures for the general audience , held by Ludvig Faddeev and Singer Among its activities , the center runs the Levi Civita colloquia References External links Home page http cmtp uniroma2 it index php http cmtp uniroma2 it documents 100804Sole24ore pdf http cmtp uniroma2 it documents 100917Messaggero pdf https web archive org web 20110722041533 http www lswn it en conferences 2010 seminal interactions between mathematics and physics http www adnkronos com IGN News Cronaca Ricerca con il Cmtp e nato a Roma un nuovo gruppo di ragazzi di Via Panisperna 985806198 html http cmtp uniroma2 it documents 100921DNews pdf http matematica unibocconi it news apre roma un nuovo centro la ricerca matematica e fisica teorica http www3 lastampa it scienza sezioni news articolo lstp 333282 http cmtp uniroma2 it documents 100922ManifestoB pdf http cmtp uniroma2 it documents 100922CorrieredellaSera pdf http roma corriere it roma notizie tempo libero 10 settembre 22 casa jazz 1703811852126 shtml https web archive org web 20101114164434 http news sciencemag org scienceinsider 2010 09 romes mathematical physicists in html http www scienzainrete it contenuto articolo il centro dove matematica e fisica teorica si incontrano http cmtp uniroma2 it documents PublicServiceReview pdf Roberto Longo Alberto De Sole Alessandro Giuliani Seminal Interactions between Mathematics and Physics Levi Civita colloquia Category Mathematical institutes Category Higher education in Italy Category Physics institutes Category Educational institutions established in 2009 Category University of Rome Tor Vergata
