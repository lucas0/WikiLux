Hefner was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1949 Dead link June 27 , 2018 Hefner also became notable because of his contributions in public service , especially in Ardmore and later in Oklahoma City Although his official title in Ardmore was mayor , locals soon gave him the honorary nickname , The Judge , apparently because he was so skillful in resolving disagreements and getting unlikely allies to support community actions , such as creating the city 's water supply In Oklahoma City , he would repeat this success on a much larger scale , initiating a municipal water supply system that still serves the much expanded city at present Early life Hefner was born on February 7 , 1874 in the community of Hefner Chapel north of Lone Oak , Hunt County , Texas to William Lafayette Hefner and Sarah Jane Masters Hefner Growing up in poverty , self teaching was the only education Hefner could afford By the age of 21 , he had received only nine months of formal education , primarily from books received from a cousin at College Station which he read at night while I was working on the farm and also when I was out herding sheep In 1895 , the family had to sell the farm to pay off debts , though the proceeds were insufficient to settle them in full Just after Hefner 's 21st birthday , his father died Hefner then resolved to work the farm for the following year to clear the family debts He received 15 per month credited against the debt , and studied at night under a kerosene lamp given to him by his father in the hope of passing the entrance exams for college In 1896 , Hefner passed the examination and gained entrance to North Texas Baptist College at Jacksboro Minor , David North Texas Baptist College In Handbook of Texas Online Texas State Historical

but found work splitting wood to pay his way At Jacksboro , he met his wife , Eva Johnson , daughter of a banker She spoke four languages fluently and became valedictorian of Baylor University in 1905 , after gaining her third degree On graduation , he decided he would study law at the University of Texas in Austin , but once again found funding to be a problem As a result , he worked for a while to save up enough to pay his way and , at the age of 25 , he enrolled at the University of Texas and found himself only the second student from the South Prairie to do so His hard work was rewarded in 1902 when he graduated near the top of his law class The philosophy of hard work , which he taught to his children as hit the ball hard , did n't always pay off When he tried to take up golfing to be able to spend more time with his son , Hefner swung so hard at the ball that he broke two ribs , ending his golfing career on his first swing The boom Following his graduation , Hefner headed to Beaumont It seemed all Texas had heard of the Hamill brothers' gusher which gained Beaumont the title Oil Capital of the World for a short time Hefner decided to specialize in oil and gas law , and to save his money to invest in land that one day might produce He found a partner , and opened Parker and Hefner They landed the Southern Pacific Railroad account for their division just seven years after Hefner arrived in Austin The workload was so great that they had to hire a third partner , renaming the firm Parker , Hefner and Organ Throughout his time in Beaumont , Hefner was educating himself further in the oil and gas industry he became fascinated with geology \( or creekology as he called it \) It was also during this time that Eva graduated from Baylor University and the two were married on July 18 , 1906 They decided to move to Ardmore , Oklahoma after being involved in a Choctaw court case which dealt specifically with the Dawes Act and Indian mineral conveyances to non Indians The account states that Hefner worked for four Indian families , helping them to get their land allotment He was paid for this work with an annual interest in future profits from the mineral rights , making Hefner quite wealthy Hefner Family History in the Energy Business GHK Companies 2016 Accessed June 27 , 2018 Although it is not clear when Hefner actually moved to Ardmore with his family , he had become a resident of Ardmore by January 1 , 1908 He founded the Hefner Company , and became an expert in legal issues related to the rapidly developing oil and gas industry He immersed himself in community affairs and was made president of the local school board from 1910 to 1920 He also served as city attorney from 1911 to 1913 and city mayor from 1919 to 1927 He represented most of the major oil companies and leading independents including Humble Oil Refining Company , Magnolia Petroleum Company \( Mobil Oil \) , Pure Oil Company , Gulf Oil Company , Carter Oil , Skelly Oil , F W Merrick , and many others during his first few years in town Creekology True to his plans , Hefner used his law earnings to purchase mineral rights where he thought oil and gas might one day be produced , based upon his creekology The theory was that because oil is lighter than water , it had been forced uphill in permeable formations and become trapped in subsurface highs , or domes Surface water runs downhill , so oil should be traced by observing the course of the rivers and streams It was assumed that subsurface highs correlated to surface highs In Oklahoma , this trend was in a northwest southeast direction from Ardmore and also in a northwest southeast direction from Duncan He bought anything he could based upon his trending creekology and , by the time he became Supreme Court Justice in 1927 , he had already acquired over of land and of mineral rights Mineral conveyance During his time in Ardmore , there was much debate about whether mineral rights could be conveyed separately from fee simple title an opinion held by many noted professors of law and the authors of textbooks on oil and gas law About 1912 , shortly after the emergence of the Healdton and Cushing oil fields , Hefner prepared the first mineral deed in which he challenged conventional thinking and severed the minerals from their surface counterparts , a form that became known as the Hefner Form He soon began receiving requests for copies of his form from states as far away as Pennsylvania , and it quickly became widely accepted throughout the United States until it was recognized by law The JZ form of mineral conveyance in current use today , and approved by the Mid Continent Royalty Owners Association , is based on the original Robert A Hefner Form Another challenge came from a New York investor named W L Hernstadt in 1934 He presented the case that production would eventually come from depths greater than Hefner supported the theory , but told Hernstadt that it would come long after their time Hernstadt offered Hefner 10 per net mineral acre for his properties in Carter County and Hefner accepted , a decision that his son would later mock It was Hefner 's grandson , Robert A Hefner III , who would pioneer gas production at depths approaching in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma during the late 1970s Public service One of Hefner 's key principles , aside from his ardent faith in Christianity and service to the community , was education He served two years as city attorney in Ardmore and was elected to the Board of Education as President in 1911 a position he held until 1918 When he found a student of humble means but great promise , he quietly provided funds to make his or her continued education possible Dozens if not hundreds of youngsters received money from Hefner to continue their schooling He also liked to help those going into law , like Earl Brown , who had worked in Hefner 's office Earl Brown later inherited Hefner 's company , became vice president , board member and general counsel of Mobil Oil Company , as well as a leading author on oil and gas law Hefner was elected Mayor of Ardmore in 1920 , a position he held for six years Under his lead , Ardmore overcame a 1919 deficit of 9 , 000 to a surplus of 193 , 000 in 1926 when he stepped down In 1922 a 300 , 000 bond was also issued for Hickory Creek Reservoir , creating a water supply for Ardmore As Mayor of Ardmore , Hefner also gave the first speech ever broadcast from the city over the radio Shortly after his move to Ardmore in 1907 1908 , Hefner became known as the Judge The nickname proved apt for Hefner in 1926 , he was asked to run for the Supreme Court of Oklahoma 's Fifth District He was elected in 1927 , despite widespread corruption within the court In 1929 , three members of the court were impeached for bribery , coercion , misquotation of facts , conspiracy , corruption , interference with criminal proceedings and incompetency they were all acquitted The Federal Bureau of Investigation clearly stated Hefner 's innocence during these years and no scandal was ever attached to his name In his six years as a Supreme Court Justice , Hefner authored 504 opinions They were all important to the legal history of the state , inasmuch as many of them involved land titles of indigenous peoples In the case of Wentz v Thomas , he even issued an opinion against the Governor of Oklahoma , William H Murray Other organizations he ardently supported include the Boy Scouts of America which he served as a member of the executive council the Rotary Club of which he was President , presiding in 1923 over the National Rotary Club Convention with over 1 , 500 delegates the First Baptist Church in which he was a deacon the Dad 's Association at the

some strong support , namely E K Gaylord , Virgil Browne , and Stanley Draper The project was haunted by lawsuits and delays introduced by the opposition The vote for the 6 , 911 , 000 bond came to 7 , 578 people in favor and 7 , 182 against Hefner and city manager H E Bailey saved the city at least 1 , 280 , 000 upon the completion of the Bluff Creek water project by , among other things ,
