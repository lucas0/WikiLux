snail species has been considered a significant cause in pest issues around the world Internationally , it is the most frequently occurring invasive species of snail Outside of its native range , this snail thrives in many types of habitat in areas with mild climates It feeds voraciously and is a vector for plant pathogens , causing severe damage to agricultural crops and native plants It competes with native snail taxa , is a nuisance pest of urban areas , and spreads human disease This snail is listed as one of the top 100 invasive species in the world View 100 of the World 's Worst Invasive

accidental introduction This species has been found in China since 1931 and its initial point of distribution in China was Xiamen figure 5 The snail has also been established in the Pratas Islands ,

throughout India , the Pacific , Indian Ocean islands , Southeast Asia and the West Indies The species was established in the United States in 1936 They were brought to the U S through imports They were intended to be used for educational uses and to be pets Some were also introduced because they were accidentally shipped with other cargo Eradication is currently underway in Florida Campo Flores

Journal Link The species has recently been observed in Bhutan \( Gyelposhing , Mongar \) , where it is an invasive species It has begun to attack agricultural fields and flower gardens It is believed there that dogs have died as a result of consuming the snail and being infected by the rat lungworm , Angiostrongylus cantonensis Starting in 2010 , individuals of the species have been found in the humid , subtropical Argentine Mesopotamia The National Agricultural Health Service has established an ongoing project to detect , study , and prevent the expansion of this pest Description The adult snail is around in height and or more in length The shell has a conical shape , being about twice as high as it is broad Either clockwise \( dextral \) or counter clockwise \( sinistral \) directions can be observed in the coiling of the shell , although the dextral cone is the more common Shell colouration is highly variable , and dependent on diet Typically , brown is the predominant colour and the shell is banded Skelley , PE Dixon , WN and Hodges , G 2011 Giant African land snail and giant South American snails field recognition Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services

species , and colonies can be formed from a single gravid individual In many places , release into the wild is illegal Nonetheless , the species has established itself in some temperate climates and its habitat now includes most regions of the humid tropics , including many Pacific islands , southern and eastern Asia , and the Caribbean The giant snail can now be found in agricultural areas , coastland , natural forest , planted forests , riparian zones , scrub and shrublands , urban areas , and wetlands Feeding thumb Feeding on Crinum leaves The giant African snail is a macrophytophagous herbivore it eats a wide range of plant material , fruit , and vegetables , paper , and cardboard It sometimes eats sand , very small stones , bones from carcasses , and even concrete as calcium sources for its shell In rare instances , the snails consume each other In captivity , this species can be fed on a wide range of fruit and vegetables , plain unseasoned mince , or boiled egg They can also occasionally be fed cuttlefish bone , which is commonly used as a calcium source for healthy shell growth They require about 18 28 of crude protein in their diet for optimal growth Soares C M ,

and is capable of producing both sperm and ova Instances of self fertilization are rare , occurring only in small populations Although both snails in a mating pair can simultaneously transfer gametes to each other \( bilateral mating \) , this is dependent on the size difference between the partners Snails of similar size can reproduce in this way Two snails of differing sizes mate unilaterally \( one way \) , with the larger individual acting as a female , due to the comparative resource investment associated with the different genders Like other land snails , these have intriguing mating behaviour , including petting their heads and front parts against each other Courtship can last up to half an hour , and the actual transfer of gametes can last for two hours Transferred sperm can be stored within the body up to two years The number of eggs per clutch averages around 200 A snail may lay five to six clutches per year with a hatching viability around 90 Adult size is reached in about six months , after which growth slows , but does not cease until death Life expectancy is commonly five to six years in captivity , but the snails can live for up to 10 years They are active at night and spend the day buried underground left thumb Fresh eggsleft thumb Hatching from eggsleft thumb Juvenile snail The giant African snail is capable of aestivating up to three years in times of extreme drought , sealing itself into its shell by secretion of a calcareous compound that dries on contact with the air Parasites Parasites of Achatina fulica include Aelurostrongylus abstrusus PDF

preventive measures include strict quarantine to prevent introduction and further spread This snail has been given top national quarantine significance in the United States In the past , quarantine officials have been able to successfully intercept and eradicate incipient invasions on the mainland USA They are also known to damage buildings by eating stucco and similar materials for the calcium https www cbsnews com news giant snails attack florida In the wild , this species often harbors the parasitic nematode Angiostrongylus cantonensis , which can cause a very serious meningitis in humans Human cases of this meningitis usually result from a person having eaten the raw or undercooked snail , but even handling live wild snails of this species can infect a person with the nematode , thus causing a life threatening infection In some regions , an effort has been made to promote use of the giant African snail as a food resource to reduce its populations However , promoting a pest in this way is a controversial measure , because it may encourage the further deliberate spread of the snails One particularly catastrophic attempt to biologically control this species occurred on South Pacific Islands Colonies of A fulica were introduced as a food reserve for the American military during World War II and they escaped A carnivorous species \( Florida rosy wolfsnail , Euglandina rosea \) was later introduced by the United States government , in an attempt to control A fulica , but the rosy wolf snail instead heavily preyed upon the native Partula snails , causing the extinction of most Partula species within a decade Human use thumb Individual being kept as a pet These snails are used by some practitioners of Candombl for religious purposes in Brazil as an offering to the deity Oxal The snails substitute for a closely related species , the African giant snail \( Archachatina marginata \) normally offered in Nigeria The two species share a common name \( gb n , also known as ibi or boi de oxal in Brazil \) , and are similar enough in appearance to satisfy religious authorities They are also edible if cooked properly In Taiwan , this species is used in the dish of \( hot frying snails \) , which is a delicacy among the traditional drinking snacks L fulica also constitutes the predominant land snail found in Chinese markets , and larger African species have potential as small , efficient livestock The snails have also become increasingly popular as pets in countries including France and the UK , where various companies have sold the animal both as a pet and an education aide L fulica is one of the most common snails being sold in the pet trade The heparinoid acharan sulfate is isolated from this species References This article incorporates CC BY 2 0 text
