against the redeployment of the Pacific portion of the fleet forward to Pearl Harbor , believing that a forward defense was neither practical nor useful , and that the Pacific Fleet would be the logical first target in the event of war with Japan , vulnerable to air and torpedo attacks He was subsequently relieved of command in February 1941 His concerns were to be proved justified in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor ten months later Early life and career Richardson was born in Paris , Texas He entered the United States Naval Academy in 1898 and graduated fifth in a class of eighty

\) At the time of his appointment , Richardson was particularly suited for the post Richardson was one of the Navy 's foremost figures Since his earliest days , after leaving Annapolis , he had made the study of Japanese warfare his life 's work He was beyond question the Navy 's outstanding authority on Pacific naval warfare and Japanese strategy Flynn , John The Final Secret of Pearl Harbor \( October 1945 \) thumb Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox on with Richardson following him \( center \) in 1940 He held this position during a stressful period marked by Presidential orders to deploy the Pacific part of the fleet to Pearl Harbor from its traditional naval base in San Diego , California Richardson noted that In 1940 , the policy making branch of the Government in foreign affairs the President and the Secretary of State thought that stationing the Fleet in Hawaii would restrain the Japanese They did not ask their senior military advisors whether it would accomplish such an end Richardson protested this redeployment to President Franklin D Roosevelt and to others in Washington He did believe that advanced bases like Guam and Hawaii were necessary but that insufficient funding and efforts had been made to prepare them for use in wartime He also believed future battles in the Pacific would involve aircraft carriers and more scouting forces would be needed to locate them Richardson recognized how vulnerable the Fleet was in such an exposed and remote position , a logistical nightmare only made worse by the slim resources , and lack of preparation and organization Richardson argued such a forward defense was not practical or useful , despite Japan 's attack on China and whatever promises had been made to Britain to come to their aid if attacked According to journalist John T Flynn , the fleet had little in the way of housing , materials , or defensive mechanisms at Pearl Harbor Richardson wanted to return to the West Coast , prepare the fleet , and then perhaps return to Pearl Harbor It was Richardson 's belief and indeed generally supported by the Navy that the Fleet should never be berthed inside Pearl Harbor where it would be a mark for attack This was particularly true in such troubled times when the airways of the East were hot with rumors of approaching conflict What is more , Richardson held the belief that Pearl Harbor was the logical first point of attack for the Japanese High Command , wedded as it was to the theory of undeclared and surprise warfare For ten years the U S Navy held attacks on the Army defenses at Pearl Harbor , and were always successful Defending the base was rather hopeless , in his mind Richardson made two trips to Washington to meet with Roosevelt to discuss the issue He followed this up with an official letter to the Chief of Naval Operations \( CNO \) , Admiral Harold R Stark , pointing out that it was Richardson 's firm conviction that neither the Navy nor the country was prepared for war with Japan After his early October visit to Roosevelt , on October 26 , 1940 , a White House leak to the Washington based Kiplinger Newsletter predicted Richardson would be removed as fleet commander Most believed he might be promoted upwards to replace Harold Stark as CNO But instead he was fired On 1 February 1941 , General Order 143 reorganized the United States Fleet In its place , the U S Atlantic
