The Jesus Lizard is an American rock band formed in 1987 in Austin , Texas and based in Chicago , Illinois They were a leading noise rock band in the American independent underground who turned out a series of independent records filled with scathing , disembowelling , guitar driven pseudo industrial noise , all of which received positive reviews in underground music publications and heavy college radio play After a brief run as a recording only project based in Austin , founding vocalist David Yow , bassist David Wm Sims , and guitarist Duane Denison relocated to Chicago , Illinois in 1989 , where they found kindred spirits in recording engineer Steve Albini and Touch and Go Records With the addition of drummer Mac McNeilly , they began performing live , eventually attracting an international audience Drummer Jim Kimball replaced McNeilly late in 1996 , and was himself replaced by Brendan Murphy two years later Despite releasing a split single with leading alt rockers Nirvana and signing to Capitol Records , the band failed to find commercial success amid the alternative rock explosion of the 1990s and disbanded in 1999 Their reunion tour ten years later garnered positive responses from audiences and critics The Jesus Lizard performed another reunion tour in 2017 History Formation and Touch Go years \( 1987 1994 \) The band began in Austin , Texas , when guitarist Duane Denison asked David Yow , formerly of Scratch Acid , to play bass on some songs he wanted to record Yow suggested that he sing and have former Scratch Acid bassist David Wm Sims play bass

moved to Chicago in 1988 , and Denison followed the next year Their first EP , Pure , was recorded by Albini and released by Touch Go in 1989 It is the only record by the band that uses a drum machine

and legacy Their music featured a scathing mix of piercing guitar , machine like drums , propulsive bass guitar , and psychotic vocals Denison 's stinging guitar often served more as texture or coloring than as a rhythm or lead instrument , while the rhythm section 's stops and starts were simultaneously precise and brutal David Sprague suggests that Yow 's disjointed couplets are reminiscent of a preacher speaking in tongues Sprague , David Jesus Lizard Trouser Press , 2007 Retrieved on March 4 , 2009 Albini typically kept vocals low in the mix , or much less prominent than was typical of rock and roll recordings In Our Band Could Be Your Life , Michael Azerrad writes that on the Jesus Lizard albums Albini recorded , singer David Yow sounds like a kidnap victim trying to howl through the duct tape over his mouth the effect is horrific Azerrad , Michael Our Band Could Be Your Life Little Brown and Company , 2002 Yow does n't consider himself a singer in the usual sense , but rather , thinks of himself as a vocal stylist While appreciated as a unique vocalist , Yow was more often cited for his confrontational antics on stage , often leaping into the crowd or taking off his clothes He was also known to lick members of the crowd while climbing all over them and sometimes striking up conversation mid song The band have been cited as an influence or as a favorite by
