thumb right Paulo Afonso Hydroelectric Powerplant in the State of Bahia Renewable energy accounted for more than 85 4 per cent of the domestically produced electricity used in Brazil Renewable energy in Brazil Brazil started focusing on developing alternative sources of energy , mainly sugarcane ethanol , after the oil shocks in the 1970s Brazil 's large sugarcane farms helped the development In 1985 , 91 per cent of cars produced that year ran on sugarcane ethanol The success of flexible fuel vehicles , introduced in 2003 , together with the mandatory E25 blend throughout the country , have allowed ethanol fuel consumption in the country to achieve a 50 per cent market share of the gasoline powered fleet by February 2008 90 of cars produced in Brazil are Flexfuel Brazil relies on hydroelectricity for more than of its electricity However , the authorities are pushing biomass and wind as the primary alternatives Wind energy has the greatest potential in Brazil during the dry season , so it is considered a hedge against low rainfall and the geographical spread of existing hydro resources In January 2015 , a drought in Brazil that cut water to the country 's hydroelectric dams prompted severe energy shortages This crisis , which ravaged the country 's economy and led to electricity rationing , underscored Brazil 's pressing need to diversify away from water power Brazil held its first wind only energy auction in 2009 , in a move to diversify its energy portfolio Foreign companies scrambled to take part The bidding is expected to lead to the construction of 2 gigawatts \( GW \) of wind production with an investment of about US 6 billion over the next two years Brazil 's technical potential for wind energy is 143 GW due to the country 's blustery kilometres coastline where most projects are based The Brazilian Wind Energy Association and the government have set a goal of achieving 20 GW of wind energy capacity by 2020 from the current 5 GW \( 2014 \) The industry hopes the auction will help kick start the wind energy sector , which already accounts for 70 per cent of the total in all of Latin America Wind power and hydroelectricity in Brazil Hydroelectricity Hydroelectric power plants produce almost 80 per cent of the electrical energy consumed in Brazil Brazil has the third highest potential for hydroelectricity , following Russia and China http thebrazilbusiness com article hydro electricity in brazil Itaipu power plant thumb right View of Itaipu hydroelectric power plant in the State of Paran thumb right A small hydroelectric power plant in Wenceslau Braz , Minas Gerais The Itaipu Dam is the world 's second largest hydroelectric power station by installed capacity Built on the Paran River dividing Brazil and Paraguay , the dam provides over 75 per cent of Paraguay 's electric power needs , and meets more than 20 per cent of Brazil 's total electricity demand The river runs along the border of the two countries , and during the initial diplomatic talks for the dam construction both countries were suffering from droughts The original goal was therefore to provide better management and utilization of water resources for the irrigation of crops Argentina was also later incorporated in some of the governmental planning and agreements because it is directly affected , being downstream , by the regulation of the water on the river If the dam were to completely open the water flow , areas as far south as Buenos Aires could potentially flood Construction of the dam started in 1975 , and the first generator was opened in 1983 It is estimated that 10 , 000 locals were displaced by the construction of the dam , and around 40 , 000 people were hired to help with the construction of the project Many environmental concerns were overlooked when constructing the dam , due to the tradeoff considering the production of such a large amount of energy without carbon emissions , and no immediate harmful byproducts , such as with nuclear energy Wind power thumb right Windfarm in Os rio , Rio Grande do Sul Wind power in Brazil amounts to an installed capacity of more than 8 GW as of 2015 Potential of wind in Brazil is more intense from June to December , coinciding with the months of lower rainfall intensity This puts the wind as a potential complementary source of energy to hydroelectricity Wind power in Brazil G1 News While the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference \( COP15 \) was taking place in Copenhagen , Brazil 's National Electric Energy Agency \( ANEEL \) held the country 's first ever wind only energy auction On December 14 2009 , around 1 , 800 megawatts \( MW \) were contracted with energy from 71 wind power plants scheduled to be delivered beginning July 1 , 2012 Growth of wind energy Brazil 's first wind energy turbine was installed in Fernando de Noronha Archipelago in 1992 Ten years later the government created the Program for Incentive of Alternative Electric Energy Sources \( Proinfa \) to encourage the use of other renewable sources , such as wind power , biomass , and small hydro Since the inception of Proinfa , Brazil 's wind energy production has grown from 22 MW in 2003 to 602 MW in 2009 , and to over 8 , 700 MW by 2015 Developing these wind power sources in Brazil is helping the country to meet its strategic objectives of enhancing energy security , reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating jobs The potential for this type of power generation in Brazil could reach up to 145 , 000 MW , according to the 2001 Brazilian Wind Power Potential Report by the Electric Energy Research Centre \( Cepel \) Solar power The total installed photovoltaic power capacity in Brazil is estimated to be between 12 and 15 MWp , of which 50 per cent is for telecommunications systems and 50 per cent for rural energy systems It is less than 0 01 per cent of the energy in Brazil Brazil has one of the highest solar incidence in the world Brazilian Atlas for Solar Energy Resource SWERA Results Ethanol fuel Brazil 's ethanol program started in 1975 , when soaring oil prices put a chokehold on the economy Sugarcane was an obvious candidate , given Brazil 's almost endless amount of arable land and favourable climate Ethanol in Brazil USA Today Most cars on the road today in Brazil can run on blends of up to 25 per cent ethanol , and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends Most car makers in Brazil sell flexible fuel cars , trucks , and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 100 per cent ethanol \( E100 \) In 2009 , 90 per cent of cars produced that year ran on sugarcane ethanol Brazil is the second largest producer of ethanol in the world and is the largest exporter of the fuel In 2008 , Brazil produced 454 , 000 bbl d of ethanol , up from 365 , 000 in 2007 All gasoline in Brazil contains ethanol , with blending levels varying from 2025 per cent Over half of all cars in the country are of the flex fuel variety , meaning that they can run on 100 per cent ethanol or an ethanol gasoline mixture According to ANP , Brazil also produced about 20 , 000 bbl d of biodiesel in 2008 , and the agency has enacted a 3 per cent blending requirement for domestic diesel sales The importance of ethanol in Brazil 's domestic transportation fuels market will only increase in the future According to Petrobr s , ethanol accounts for more than 50 per cent of current light vehicle fuel demand , and the company expects this to increase to over 80 per cent by 2020 Because ethanol production continues to grow faster than domestic demand , Brazil has sought to increase ethanol exports According to industry sources , Brazil 's ethanol exports reached 86 , 000 bbl d in 2008 , with 13 , 000 bbl d going to the United States Brazil is the largest ethanol exporter in the world , holding over 90 per cent of the global export market Ethanol fuel in Brazil Hydrogen The Center of Management and Strategic Studies \( under the supervision of the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology \) has published a document titled Energetic Hydrogen in Brazil funding for competitive politics 2010 2025 \( Portuguese Hidrogenio energetico no Brasil subsidios para pol ticas de competitividade 2010 2025 \) , giving numbers of a hydrogen scenario in the country related to its research , technologies and funding The document reports Brazil as a leader in Latin America but yet with an investment in hydrogen technologies of only 3 to 5 per cent of Japan , European Union , or the United States National hydrogen production is about 920 , 000 t \( 10 2 billion cubic metres \) per year with only 1 per cent used as a direct fuel and the other 99 per cent for refining , petrochemical , fertilizers and methanol Biomass thumb right Sugarcane plantation in Avar \( State of S o Paulo \) , cane remains used to production of biomass energy thumb right Eucalyptus in the State of Esp rito Santo , remains of the tree are reused for biomass power generation Biomass is a clean energy source used in Brazil It reduces environmental pollution as it uses organic garbage , agricultural remains , wood shaving or vegetal oil Refuse cane , with its high energetic value , has been used to produce electricity Biomass in Brazil More than 1 million people in the country works in the production of Biomass , and this energy represents 27 per cent of Brazil 's energetic matrix Facts of Brazil 's Biomass The recent interest in converting biomass to electricity comes not only from its potential as a low cost , indigenous supply of power , but for its potential environmental and developmental benefits For example , biomass may be a globally important mitigation option to reduce the rate of CO2 buildup by sequestering carbon and by displacing fossil fuels Renewably grown biomass contributes only a very small amount of carbon to the atmosphere Locally , plantations can lessen soil erosion , provide a means to restore degraded lands , offset emissions and local impacts from fossil fired power generation , and , perhaps , reduce demands on existing forests In addition to the direct power and environmental benefits , biomass energy systems offer numerous other benefits , especially for developing countries , such as Brazil Some of these benefits include the employment of underutilised labour and the production of co and by products , for example , fuelwood Nearly all of the experiences with biomass for power generation is based on the use of waste and residue fuels \( primarily wood wood wastes and agricultural residues \) The production of electric power from plantation grown wood is an emerging technology with considerable promise However , actual commercial use of plantation grown fuels for power generation is limited to a few isolated experiences Wood from plantations is not an inexpensive energy feedstock , and as long as worldwide prices of coal , oil and gas are relatively low , the establishment of plantations dedicated to supplying electric power or other higher forms of energy will occur only where financial subsidies or incentives exist or where other sources of energy are not available The biomass plantations are supplying energy on a commercial basis , such as in Brazil , the Philippines and Sweden , it can be shown that a combination of government policies or high conventional energy prices have stimulated the use of short rotation plantations for energy Brazil used tax incentives beginning in the mid 1960s to initiate a reforestation program to provide for industrial wood energy and wood product needs As a consequence of the Brazilian Forestry Code with its favourable tax incentives , the planted forest area in Brazil increased from 470 , 000hectares to 6 5 millionhectares by 1993 With the discontinuation of the tax incentives in 1988 , plantation establishment in Brazil has slowed although the commercial feasibility of using eucalyptus for energy and other products has been clearly demonstrated Bioenergy Biomass in Brazil See also
