partial stay that would allow every state except for Texas to start implementing Obama s executive amnesty On March 3 , 2015 , the DOJ filed an Advisory with the court , notifying it that the U S Citizenship and Immigration Services had granted three year periods of deferred action to 108 , 081 individuals between the publishing of the Department of Homeland Security \( DHS \) Directive on November 24 , 2014 implementing Obama s executive action and Judge Hanen s injunction order on 16 February 2015 This directly contradicted earlier statements made to the court by DOJ that no applications would be accepted prior to February 18 , 2015 , nor decisions on such applications would be made prior to March 4 , 2015 The states responded by requesting an Opposed Motion for Early Discovery , alleging misrepresentation by the DOJ attorneys as well as DHS officials who are named as defendants in the case concerning when and how parts of the DHS directive would be implemented On March 13 , 2015 , Justice Hanen held a supplementary hearing on the DOJ advisory at which Angela Colmonero from the Texas Attorney General 's office protested the defendants renewal of deferred action permits for an expanded term of not two but three years under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \( DACA \) program During the hearings leading to an injunction handed down by Hanen , attorneys with the Department of Justice had claimed that if an injunction was filed nothing would be done Colmonero said that the Federal Department of Justice \( DOJ \) informed the Court 15 days

grounds for the motion point by point He affirmed his earlier ruling that the plaintiff states had standing cited statements made by President Obama regarding the applicability of the Administrative Procedure Act \( APA \) that DHS employees would suffer consequences if they failed to follow the DHS Directive cited case law to deny the DOJ request to apply the injunction only to Texas and addressed the issue of irreparable harm both in regards to the federal government and to the states Also published on April 7 , 2015 , was Judge Hanen s order addressing the states request for an Opposed Motion for Early Discovery , regarding the plaintiffs allegation that the DOJ and DHS had made misrepresentations to the court during the initial injunction hearing concerning when and how parts of the DHS directive would be implemented Judge Hanen sided with the plaintiffs , taking the defendants to task for the multiple representations made by the Government s counsel that no action would be taken by DHS prior to February 18 , 2015 He went on to cite from the court record instances where DOJ attorneys stated to the court in writing in the Advisory and also orally that no action would be taken enforcing the DHS Directive prior to February 18 , 2015 In a sharp rebuke to DOJ counsel , Judge Hanen stated that , Whether by ignorance , omission , purposeful misdirection , or because they were misled by their clients , the attorneys for the Government misrepresented the facts He pointed out that DOJ counsel urged him to rule before they had disclosed that DHS had already begun actions under the DHS Directive , despite their knowledge to the contrary He proceeded to cite from the Rules of Professional Conduct of the American Bar Association and the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct , and chastised defense counsel saying , Fabrications , misstatements , half truths , artful omissions , and the failure to correct misstatements may be acceptable , albeit lamentable , in other aspects of life but in the courtroom , when an attorney knows that both the Court and the other side are relying on complete frankness , such conduct is unacceptable Judge Hanen reserved the right to impose sanctions against DOJ counsel pending the results of the directed discovery , then directed the defendants to provide complete records of all drafts of the March 3 , 2015 Advisory , including metadata and a list of all persons aware of the Advisory and when they were aware of it He further enjoined the defendants from destroying or erasing any documents relating to it , whether in hard copy , electronic records , or storage devices Appeals Court On March 12 , 2015 , the Obama administration filed the appeal in New Orleans justice gov Case 15 40238 , Document
