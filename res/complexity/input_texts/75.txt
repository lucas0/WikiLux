Rupert Maxwell \( Max \) Stuart \( c 1932 \) is an Australian Aborigine who was convicted of murder in 1959 His conviction was subject to several appeals to higher courts , the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council , and a Royal Commission , all of which upheld the verdict Newspapers campaigned successfully against the death penalty being imposed After serving his sentence , Stuart became an Arrernte elder and from 1998 2001 was the chairman of the Central Land Council In 2002 , a film was made about the crime and his case Early life thumb Jay Creek in 1947 Stuart was born in 1932 at Jay Creek in the MacDonnell Ranges , 45 kilometres west of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory It was a government settlement which for a time in the late 1920s and early 1930s included 45 children from a home named 'The Bungalow' \( 37 of whom were under the age of 12 \) temporarily housed in a corrugated shed with a superintendent and matron housed separately in two tents Jay Creek was home to the Western Arrernte people In 1937 , Jay Creek was declared one of three permanent camps or reserves for the Alice Springs Aboriginal population It was intended as a buffer between the semi nomadic people living in far western regions and the more sophisticated inhabitants of Alice Springs and environs , in particular for the non working , aged and infirm around Alice Springs As a teenager , Stuart had worked as a bare knuckle boxer and for Jimmy Sharman 's boxing tents In late 1958 , he was working on the sideshows of a travelling fun fair He was mostly illiterate and had problems with alcohol In the late 1950s , Stuart had been convicted of indecently assaulting a nine year old girl in Cloncurry , Queensland In that case , he confessed to police that he knew this was wrong but he did not know any big women and that when he had liquor he could not control himself The Stuart Case On 20 December 1958 , Mary Hattam , a nine year old girl , disappeared near the South Australian town of Ceduna After playing on the beaches between Ceduna and Thevenard , she had not come home Her parents alerted the police , and a community wide search took place Hattam 's body was found at midnight , bloodied and mangled , with her face smashed in She had been raped and murdered The local police brought in two 'blacktrackers' \( Aboriginal trackers \) who then traced the crime to Stuart The travelling funfair , Fun Land Carnival , which Stuart was working with , was visiting the town at the time Following his signed and witnessed confession , Stuart was brought to trial in the Supreme Court of South Australia , with the case opening on 20 April 1959 The Judge presiding was Sir Geoffrey Reed , an experienced judge Stuart 's lawyer was J D O'Sullivan , assigned to him by the Law Society of South Australia O'Sullivan advocated that police had forced Stuart into the confession , due to Stuart 's poor command of the English language However , the jury was unconvinced by the argument and Stuart was convicted In line with the law , Judge Reed sentenced Stuart to death on April 24 1959 Two appeals were filed but neither was successful an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London failed A prison chaplain , Catholic priest Father Tom Dixon was suspicious about the sophisticated language used in the alleged confession Stuart could hardly speak or write English his native language was Arrernte The anthropologist Ted Strehlow , who had studied the Arrernte people of central Australia , also had doubts and was called as a witness in the case Ken Inglis , then a lecturer at Adelaide University , wrote in July 1959 of the doubts of Father Dixon and Ted Strehlow in the Nation , a fortnightly magazine There was further reporting on the case in the Sydney Morning Herald and then Adelaide afternoon newspaper , the News , took up the issue Royal Commission In late 1959 a Royal Commission , the Royal Commission in Regard to Rupert Max Stuart , was convened by the South Australian government The Commission was appointed to enquire into matters raised in statutory declarations regarding Stuart 's actions and intentions , his movements on 20 December 1958 , why the information in the declarations was not raised in the Supreme Court or another authority before the declarations were made , and the circumstances in which the declarations were obtained and made The Commission concluded that Stuart 's conviction was justified However , the Playford Government commuted his sentence to life imprisonment Newspaper campaigns against death sentence The News , edited by Rohan Rivett and owned by Rupert Murdoch , campaigned heavily against Stuart 's death sentence Because of the campaign through the News , Rivett , as editor , and the News itself were charged in 1960 with seditious and malicious libel , but were acquitted A few weeks later Murdoch dismissed Rivett Rivett had been Editor in Chief of the News since 1951 It has been suggested that in Black and White , a 2002 film of the case , the role of Murdoch was magnified , and the part of his editor , Rivett , was minimised However , it was noted in the Royal Commission that Murdoch wrote editorials , headlines and posters for the campaign Stuart says of Murdoch that He done a good one in my case and also He wanted the truth , you know I could see him out in the court I was with the policemen my lawyer told me it was him Imprisonment Stuart was released on parole in 1973 He was in and out of jail until 1984 , when he was paroled for the sixth and final time

being returned to prison a number of times for breaches of his parole between 1974 and 1984 , he married and settled at Santa Teresa , a Catholic mission south east of Alice Springs Publications on

, It ain t half bad , but it s a long time to wait between smokes ! Significance of the case Geoffrey Robertson QC said of the case It was a dramatic and very important case because it alerted Australia to the difficulties that Aborigines , who then were n't even counted in the census , encountered in our courts It alerted us to the appalling feature of capital punishment of the death sentence that applied to people who may well be innocent Indigenous politics In 1985 , Patrick Dodson , then director of the Central Land Council , appointed the unrepentant Stuart to a part time job This appointment transformed Stuart , giving him respect and gave rise to his successful rehabilitation Stuart shared his knowledge of Aboriginal law and tradition , which he had gained from his grandfather as a youth , and become an Arrernte elder Stuart has subsequently become an active figure in Central Australian Aboriginal affairs , in particular with the Lhere Artepe native title organisation Stuart was chairman of the Central Land Council \( CLC \) from 1998 to 2001 In 2000 , as chairman of the CLC , Stuart welcomed the Queen to Alice Springs and made a presentation to her in September 2001 , Stuart was cultural director of the Yeperenye Federation Festival In 2004 , Stuart was the Public Officer for the CANCA Aboriginal Corporation , a role derived from his employment with the Central Land Council References includes a discussion of the case and town locations associated with the case Category 1932 births Category Australian convicted child sex offenders Category Australian murderers of children Category Australian royal commissions Category Indigenous Australians Category Living people
