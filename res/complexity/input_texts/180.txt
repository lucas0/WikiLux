In genetics , paternal mtDNA transmission and paternal mtDNA inheritance refer to the incidence of paternal mitochondrial DNA \( mtDNA \) being passed on to offspring Paternal mtDNA inheritance is observed in a small proportion of species , but in the vast majority of species , including humans , mtDNA is believed to be passed unchangedThe mtDNA is passed from mother to offspring unchanged except for the occasional genetic mutation , the rate of which is unknown but is sometimes estimated as once every 600 generations \( see Mitochondrial DNA Mutation Rates \) from a mother to her offspring However , mtDNA transmission from both parents is the rule , not the exception , in certain bivalves In animals Paternal mtDNA inheritance in animals varies For example , in Mytilidae mussels , paternal mtDNA is transmitted through the sperm and establishes itself only in the male gonad Male and Female Mitochondrial DNA Lineages in the Blue Mussel \( Mytilus edulis \) Species Group by Donald T Stewart , Carlos Saavedra , Rebecca R Stanwood , Amy 0 Ball , and Eleftherios Zouros In testing 172 sheep , The Mitochondrial DNA from three lambs in two half sib families were found to show paternal inheritance Mitochondria in mammalian sperm are usually destroyed by the egg cell after fertilization In 1999 it was reported that paternal sperm mitochondria \( containing mtDNA \) are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo Some in vitro fertilization techniques \( IVF \) , particularly intracytoplasmic sperm injection \( ICSI \) of a sperm into an oocyte , may interfere with this In humans Most sources , notably companies that sell genealogical DNA tests , state that paternal mtDNA is never transmitted to offspring e g Maternal inheritance of human mitochondrial DNA , R E Giles , H Blanc , H M Cann , and D C Wallace , PNAS November 1 , 1980 vol 77 no 11 6715 6719 This belief is central to mtDNA genealogical DNA testing and to the theory of mitochondrial Eve However , there have been some studies that claimed to have found some cases of paternal mitochondrial inheritance in humans \( e g Schwarz Vissing 2002 \) , and it was proposed that in sexual reproduction , the tail of the sperm does enter the egg , and thus paternal leakage may occur The ideas about human paternal leakage were summed up in the 1996 study Misconceptions about mitochondria and mammalian fertilization Implications for theories on human evolution The following quotation comes from the abstract to that peer reviewed study printed in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences The mixing of maternal and paternal mtDNA was thought to have been found in humans and chimpanzees as PDF However , there has been only a single known case of human paternal mitochondrial DNA transmission A male will rarely get his father 's mtDNA So far , this has been observed one time in the past 20 years of research Jordan Surname DNA Project Tutorial All other reported cases can be ascribed solely to contamination and sample mix up Responses to this evidence involves saying that so little paternal mtDNA is transmitted as to be negligible \( Some researchers argue that a fragment of the father 's mtDNA is in fact passed on , though it represents much less than 1 percent of the total NOVA Teachers America 's Stone Age Explorers Classroom Activity \) or saying that paternal mtDNA is so rarely transmitted as to be negligible \( Nevertheless , studies have established that paternal mtDNA is so rarely transmitted to offspring that mtDNA analyses remain valid evolutionary biologist Andrew Merriwether quoted in Debunking a myth about sperm 's DNA \( research indicates paternal mitochondrial DNA does enter fertilized egg \) by John Travis , Science News , 1 25 1997 \) It has also been said in early studies that about 1 2 of a person 's mitochondria can be inherited from the father Mitochondria can be inherited from both parents , New Scientist article on Schwartz and Vissing 's report According to the 2005 study More evidence for non maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA \? , in addition , heteroplasmy is a newly discovered form of inheritance for mtDNA Heteroplasmy introduces slight statistical uncertainty in normal inheritance patterns Re Most recent common ancestor Heteroplasmy occurs when two slightly different mitochondrial sequences are inherited from the mother , as a result of several hundred mitochondria being present in the ovum In either case , these phenomena throw doubt on the theory that all mtDNA can be traced back to a single female This theory of mitochondrial Eve , which aims to trace all humans to a woman living in sub Saharan Africa 100 , 000 to 200 , 000 years agoAfrican Eve Theory Smashed by Computer by Marvin Lubenow , July 1992 allows no room for the inheritance of paternal mtDNA In protozoa Some organisms , such as Cryptosporidium , have mitochondria with no DNA whatsoever In plants It has also been reported that mitochondria can occasionally be inherited from the father , e g in bananas Some Conifers also show paternal inheritance of mitochondria , such as the coast redwood , Sequoia sempervirens See also Y chromosomal Adam Patrilineality Matrilineality Human mitochondrial genetics Human migration RecLOH List of genetic genealogy topics References and notes External links \( as PDF \) Paternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA \( PDF \) by Marianne Schwartz and John Vissing , 2002 Paradise lost Mitochondrial eve refuted by M Pickford , July 2006 PubMed search results for paternal leakage search results for paternal mtDNA search results for father 's mtDNA Category Genetic genealogy Category Modern human genetic history Category Genetics
