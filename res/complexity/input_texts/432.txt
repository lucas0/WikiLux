Guaranteed Minimum Income \( GMI \) is a proposed systemHistory of Basic Income , Basic Income Earth Network \( BIEN \) , retrieved on 18 June 2009 of social welfare provision that guarantees that all citizens or families have an income sufficient to live on , provided they meet certain conditions Eligibility is typically determined by citizenship , a means test and either availability for the labour market or a willingness to perform community services The primary goal of a Guaranteed Minimum Income is to combat poverty If citizenship is the only requirement , the system turns into a Basic Income guarantee Elements A system of Guaranteed Minimum Income can consist of several elements , most notably a minimum wage , either set by the government or resulting from negotiations of employers or their organizations with trade unions a calculation of the social minimum , usually below the minimum wage a safety net , to help citizens or families without sufficient financial means survive at the social minimum This may be a transfer or , in some cases , a loan , and is generally conditional to availability for work , performance of community services , some kind of social contract , or commitment to a reintegration trajectory child support by the government student grants and student loans state pension for the elderly Basic income A Basic Income is granted independent of other income \( including salaries \) and wealth , with no other requirement than citizenship This is a special case of GMI , based on additional ideologies and or goals While most modern countries have some form of Guaranteed Minimum Income , a Basic Income is rare A Basic Income is a proposed system of social security , that periodically provides each citizen with a sum of money that is sufficient to live on Except for citizenship , a Basic Income is entirely unconditional There is no means test the richest as well as the poorest citizens would receive it A Basic Income is often proposed in the form of a citizen 's dividend \( a transfer \) or a Negative Income Tax \( a guarantee \) A Basic Income less than the social minimum is referred to as a Partial Basic Income A worldwide Basic Income , typically including income redistribution between nations , is known as a Global Basic Income One of the arguments for a basic income was articulated by French economist and philosopher Andr Gorz The connection between more and better has been broken our needs for many products and services are already more than adequately met , and many of our as yet unsatisfied needs will be met not by producing more , but by producing differently , producing other things , or even producing less This is especially true as regards our needs for air , water , space , silence , beauty , time and human contact From the point where it takes only 1 , 000 hours per year or 20 , 000 to 30 , 000 hours per lifetime to create an amount of wealth equal to or greater than the amount we create at the present time in 1 , 600 hours per year or 40 , 000 to 50 , 000 hours in a working life , we must all be able to obtain a real income equal to or higher than our current salaries in exchange for a greatly reduced quantity of work Neither is it true any longer that the more each individual works , the better off everyone will be The present crisis has stimulated technological change of an unprecedented scale and speed `the micro chip revolution' The object and indeed the effect of this revolution has been to make rapidly increasing savings in labour , in the industrial , administrative and service sectors Increasing production is secured in these sectors by decreasing amounts of labour As a result , the social process of production no longer needs everyone to work in it on a full time basis The work ethic ceases to be viable in such a situation and workbased society is thrown into crisis Andre Gorz , Critique of economic Reason \( Galil e , 1989 \) The Basic Income Earth Network \( BIEN \) describes one of the benefits of a basic income as having a lower overall cost than that of the current means tested social welfare benefits However critics have pointed out the potential work disincentives created by such a program , and have cast doubts over its implementability The Need for Basic Income An Interview with Philippe van Parijs , Imprints , Vol 1 , No 1 \( 1996 \) In later
