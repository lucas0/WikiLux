thumb Giovanni Demin 's impression of Solomon meeting the Queen of Sheba The Queen of Sheba , known in Islamic tradition as Bilquis , was invited by Solomon \( Sulayman \) to Islam and thus submitted to God The Qur'an never mentioned the Queen of Sheba by name , though Arabic sources name her Bilqis The story is similar to the one in the Bible The Qur'anic narrative , which is from sura 27 \( An Naml \) , has Solomon getting reports of a kingdom ruled by a queen whose people worship the sun He sends a message inviting her to the worship of God She replied with a gift after consulting her people The gift offends Solomon and he started to make preparations for war The Queen of Sheba then decides to meet Solomon Upon discovering that the Queen is coming to meet him , Solomon asked his people if anyone can bring the throne of the Queen before she arrives A jinn under the control of Solomon proposed that he will bring it before Solomon rises from his seat One who had knowledge of the Book proposed to bring him the throne of Bilqis 'in the twinkling of an eye' and accomplished that immediately The queen arrives at his court , is shown her throne and asked does your throne look like this \? She replied \( It is \) as though it were it When she enters his crystal palace she accepts Abrahamic monotheism and the worship of God alone Islamic Belief Addition According to Ibn Kathir 's , Qisas Al Anbiya \( Stories of the Prophets \) , Solomon traveled on a pilgrimage to the Masjid al Haram \( The Sacred Mosque \) in Mecca \( rebuilt by Abraham \( Ibr h m \) Afterwards , he continued south to the city of Sana'a , the modern day capital of Yemen , where he was impressed by the complex water channeling system Geographically , Sana'a is nearby Ma'rib , the believed capital of the land of Sheba Solomon sent the hoopoe bird to survey the land as it could detect water underground so that he may build a similar system of irrigation in his own kingdom The hoopoe returns to an angry king as it he had taken more time than expected with news of a kingdom \( Saba \) ruled by a queen \( Bilqis \) worshipping the sun The Qur'an does not blatantly mention exactly where the kingdom extended , but many Islamic sources definitely mention the capital of the kingdom as the city of Ma'rib , Yemen , located just two hours by car away from Sana'a Additionally , archaeological finds have found a temple of worship \( Ma'bed Bilqis , Bilqis' Temple , in Ma'rib , Yemen \) In 572 C E a plague of mice ate through the dam in Ma'rib , causing a flood that literally annihilated the city and its people The Qur'an mentions in sura 34 , 15 16 how the Kingdom of Sheba was destroyed centuries after Bilqis because the people reverted to polytheism There are no Islamic sources mentioning that Bilqis was the sister of the sun or daughter of a jinn spirit It is common belief that Bilqis was single at the time of her meeting Solomon and married him shortly thereafter See also Biblical narratives and the Qur'an References Queen of Sheba Queen of Sheba Category Arab queens Category History of Yemen Category Solomon
