Professor \( commonly abbreviated as Prof \) is an academic rank at universities and other post secondary education and research institutions in most countries Literally , professor derives from Latin as a person who professes being usually an expert in arts or sciences , a teacher of the highest rank In most systems of academic ranks the word professor only refers to the most senior academic position , sometimes informally known as full professor In some countries or institutions , the word professor is also used in titles of lower ranks such as associate professor and assistant professor this is particularly the case in the United States , where the word professor is sometimes used colloquially to refer to anyone in an academic post This colloquial usage would be considered incorrect among most other academic communities However , the unqualified title Professor designated with a capital letter usually refers to a full professor also in English language usage Professors often conduct original research and commonly teach undergraduate , professional or postgraduate courses in their fields of expertise In universities with graduate schools , professors may mentor and supervise graduate students conducting research for a thesis or dissertation In many universities , 'full professors' take on senior managerial roles , leading departments , research teams and institutes , and filling roles such as president , principal or vice chancellor The role of professor may be more public facing than that of more junior staff , and professors are expected to be national or international leaders in their field of expertise Etymology thumb right 150px The Ancient Greek philosopher Socrates was one of the earliest recorded professors David K Knox Socrates The

Research professor In a number of countries , the title research professor refers to a professor who is exclusively or mainly engaged in research , and who has few or no teaching obligations For example , the title is used in this sense in the United Kingdom \( where it is known as research professor at some universities and professorial research fellow at some other institutions \) and in northern Europe Research professor is usually the most senior rank of a research focused career pathway in those countries , and regarded as equal to the ordinary full professor rank Most often they are permanent employees , and the position is often held by particularly distinguished scholars thus the position is often seen as more prestigious than an ordinary full professorship The title is used in a somewhat similar sense in the United States , with the exception that research professors in the United States are often not permanent employees and often must fund their salary from external sources , Classification of Ranks and Titles which is usually not the case elsewhere In fiction thumb Professor Moriarty from the Sherlock Holmes story The Final Problem Traditional fictional portrayals of professors , in accordance with a stereotype , are shy , absent minded individuals often lost in thought In many cases , fictional professors are socially or physically awkward Examples include the 1961 film The Absent Minded Professor or Professor Calculus of The Adventures of Tintin stories Professors have also been portrayed as being misguided into an evil pathway , such as Professor Metz , who helped Bond villain Blofeld in the film Diamonds Are Forever or simply evil , like Professor Moriarty , archenemy of British detective Sherlock Holmes The modern animated series Futurama has Professor Hubert Farnsworth , a typical absent minded but genius level professor A related stereotype is the mad scientist Vladimir Nabokov , author and professor of English at Cornell , frequently used professors as the protagonists in his novels Professor Henry Higgins is a main character in George Bernard Shaw 's play Pygmalion In the Harry Potter series , set at the wizard school Hogwarts , the teachers are known as professors , many of whom play important roles , notably Professors Dumbledore , McGonagall and Snape In the board game Cluedo , Professor Plum has been depicted as an absent minded academic Christopher Lloyd played Plum 's film counterpart , a psychologist who had an affair with one of his patients Since the 1980s and 1990s , various stereotypes were re evaluated , including professors Writers began to depict professors as just normal human beings and might be quite well rounded in abilities , excelling both in intelligence and in physical skills An example of a fictional professor not depicted as shy or absent minded is Indiana Jones , a professor as well as an archeologist adventurer , who is skilled at both scholarship and fighting The popularity of the Indiana Jones movie franchise had a significant impact on the previous stereotype , and created a new archetype which is both deeply knowledgeable and physically capable The character generally referred to simply as the Professor on the television sit com series , Gilligan 's Island , although described alternatively as a high school science teacher or research scientist , is depicted as a sensible advisor , a clever inventor , and a helpful friend to his fellow castaways John Houseman 's portrayal of law school professor Charles W Kingsfield , Jr , in The Paper Chase \( 1973 \) remains the epitome of the strict , authoritarian professor who demands perfection from students Annalise Keating \( played by Viola Davis \) from the American Broadcasting Company \( ABC \) legal drama mystery television series How to Get Away with Murder is a law professor at the fictional Middleton University Early in the series , Annalise is a self sufficient and confident woman , respected for being a great law professor and a great lawyer , feared and admired by her students , whose image breaks down as the series progresses Mysterious , older men with magical powers \( and unclear academic standing \) are sometimes given the title of Professor in literature and theater Notable examples include Professor Marvel in The Wizard of Oz and Professor Drosselmeyer \( as he is sometimes known \) from the ballet The Nutcracker Also , the magician played by Christian Bale in the film , The Prestige , adopts 'The Professor' as his stage name A variation of this type of non academic professor is the crackpot inventor , as portrayed by Professor Potts in the film version of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang or the Jerry Lewis inspired Professor Frink character on The Simpsons Other professors of this type are the thoughtful and kind Professor Digory Kirke of C S Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia The title has been used by comedians , such as Professor Irwin Corey and Soupy Sales in his role as The Big Professor In the past , pianists in saloons and other rough environments have been called professor The puppeteer of a Punch and Judy show is also traditionally known as a professor See also Academic discipline Adjunct professor Sacrae Theologiae Professor \( S T P \) degree now awarded as S T D or Doctor of Divinity \( D D \) Emeritus'' Habilitation Scholarly method
