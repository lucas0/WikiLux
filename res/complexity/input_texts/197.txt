Alien abduction claimants \( also called abductees and experiencers \) are people who have claimed to have been abducted by aliens The term abduction phenomenon describes claims of non human creatures kidnapping individuals and temporarily removing them from familiar terrestrial surroundings Rodeghier , Mark Who is an Abductee \?

also be partially because people over the age of forty are less likely to have hormonic or reproductive activity going on Children as abductees Although abduction and other UFO related reports are usually made by adults , sometimes young children report similar experiences Truncale , Deborah Bruce Alien UFO Experiences of Children In Pritchard , Andrea Pritchard , David E Mack , John E Kasey , Pam Yapp , Claudia Alien Discussions Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference Cambridge North Cambridge Press Pp 116 126 These child reports often feature very specific details in common with reports of abduction made by adults , including the circumstances , narrative , entities and aftermaths of the alleged occurrences Often these young abductees have family members who have reported having abduction experiences Family involvement in the military , or a residence near a military base is also common amongst child abduction claimants Deborah Truncale , a pro abduction researcher believes that the reports made by children should be taken similarly seriously to those made by adults She notes several characteristic behaviors of children fictionalizing stories , such as pausing to think , attempting to anticipate the reaction of the listener , or trying to fake convincing eye contact Truncale sees child abduction claimants as lacking these mannerisms , instead , she says , they can be described as generally more animated than children making up stories and speak ing quickly , they recall an account without the behavior that involves story telling Some pro abduction researchers argue that children do not include the image of the Grey type alien as part of their image bank , and consequently their reports are not likely derived from cultural depictions of UFO related phenomena Budd Hopkins once investigated several mask and novelty stores for a commercially produced grey alien costume for children , but could not He feels that this supports the hypothesis that children are not familiar with greys John Carpenter also believes that young children are not contaminated with cultural images of greys He reports that a fellow investigator who is a school teacher requested her children to draw an alien , and that none of them drew a Grey like being Children seem to react to their alleged abduction experiences differently from adult claimants Many alleged adult experiencers report doubting their sanity or the veracity of what they believed happened to them Children , by contrast , never seem to doubt that their experiences happened to them For an adult , an abduction experience can challenge much of what they believe about the world Children however , by virtue of being in a formative stage of development , more readily assimilate the experience into their developing worldview Many repeat abductees report that , as children from the ages of 2 6 , they would be visited by balls of light that would enter their room at night These balls would seem to play games with children and fly around the room Some have interpreted them as being a way for the alleged abductees to develop their psychic abilities the way a physical ball helps develop coordination and athletic abilities As such these intangible orbs have been dubbed psychic toys Although these phantasms are alleged to have appeared regularly , no corroborating sightings from members of the abductees' families or others that may have been expected to see them have been reported Randles , Jenny An Analysis of British Abduction Cases In Pritchard , Andrea Pritchard , David E Mack , John E Kasey , Pam Yapp , Claudia Alien Discussions Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference Cambridge North Cambridge Press Pp 174 177 Hopkins Image Recognition Test UFO and abduction researcher Budd Hopkins has designed an image recognition test \( known as the Hopkins Image Recognition Test , or HIRT \) for Children that he claims is helpful in verifying legitimate occurrences of alien abduction There are ten different illustrated flash cards in the HIRT , nine of which depict images from myth , from the real world , and from popular culture The tenth image is the grey type entity commonly associated with claims of abduction The images are drawn simply in black and white , featuring characters drawn in what Hopkins calls a neutral and inexpressive fashion This is supposed to be a preventative measure intended to keep the images from affecting the child 's responses on an emotional basis Hopkins , Budd The Hopkins Image Recognition Test \( HIRT \) for Children In Pritchard , Andrea Pritchard , David E Mack , John E Kasey , Pam Yapp , Claudia Alien Discussions Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference Cambridge North Cambridge Press Pp 127 134 Procedure The test would be administered to two groups of about 10 12 children individually , one group being composed of children who are thought to be possible abduction experiencers , and a control group Furthermore , the test consisted of three parts The first portion test is treated as a flash card type children 's game where the administrator asks the child to identify the figure depicted on the card presented to them Hopkins reports that when the allegedly abducted children encounter the Grey face , they frequently will respond by recounting a detailed abduction narrative containing elements extremely similar to those found in claims made by adults , he even recalls an instance where a child claimant reported a baby presentation scenario Parents have sometimes supposedly seemed disturbed by their children 's responses to the Gray face He says no child in the control group of any test session has recognized or attached significance to the Grey image During the second phase of the HIRT , the administrator asks each child to separate the flash cards into two piles , one pile for those depicting characters they like , and one for those depicting characters they dislike As the child divides up the cards , the administrator asks for the child to explain the reasons they liked or disliked the characters on the cards Hopkins says that abduction candidate children usually file the alien head under the dislike category for the reasons we have come to expect By contrast , control group children often file the alien head under the like category , because they had no reason to dislike something they did n't recognize Stage three involves more active participation on the part of the children The administrator will ask the child to make up a story about an imaginary encounter with the character depicted on it This usually acts as a trigger for reporting an abduction account in the potential abductees if earlier tests had not elicited an explicit account of this type Criticism Hopkins' test has been criticized by abduction researcher David Gotlib , who felt that Hopkins 's use of terminology in describing the test implied it had been evaluated and standardized in a scientifically rigorous way , when in fact it had not Hopkins withdrew the offending statements Psychologist Richard Boylan raised a similar objection to the way Hopkins had hyped the test Boylan also voiced criticism of the test itself , noting that the grey face was the only anomalous figure in the set , and that a spooky narrative in response to the image was to be expected This , he said , was obvious , but is not probative Prevalence Reports of the abduction phenomenon have been made around the world , but are less common outside of English speaking countries , especially the United States The Roper Poll In 1991 , Hopkins , Jacobs and sociologist Dr Ron Westrum commissioned a Roper Poll in order to determine how many Americans might have experienced the abduction phenomenon Of nearly 6 , 000 Americans , 119 answered in a way that Hopkins et al interpreted as supporting their ET interpretation of the abduction phenomenon Based on this figure , Hopkins estimated that nearly four million Americans might have been abducted by extraterrestrials The poll results are available at this external link Abduction by Aliens or Sleep Paralysis Criticism Writing in Skeptical Inquirer , psychologist Susan Blackmore notes that based on her analysis , I conclude that the claim of the Roper Poll , that 3 7 million Americans have probably been abducted , is false
