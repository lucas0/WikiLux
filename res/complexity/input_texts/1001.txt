southwest of Cleveland It is bounded by Cleveland and Brooklyn on the north , Brooklyn Heights and Seven Hills on the east , North Royalton and Broadview Heights on the south , and Brook Park , Middleburg Heights , and Parma Heights , on the west Parma was originally part of Parma Township , created in 1826 The first settlers were the Benaiah Fay family from New York State , who settled along the Cleveland Columbus Road in 1816 The name was taken from Parma , New York , where it was probably derived from the early 19th century fascination with classical Italy During the 19th century , Parma remained largely agricultural In 1912 , a portion of the township seceded to form the village of Parma Heights In 1924 , Parma was incorporated as a village , and in 1926 it adopted the mayor council form of government In 1931 a proposition to annex it to the city of Cleveland was defeated , and Parma became a city Parma 's tremendous growth came after World War II as young families began moving from Cleveland into the Suburbs Between 1950 and 1980 , its population soared from less than 20 , 000 to more than 110 , 000 Kubasek , Ernest R , The History of Parma \( 1976 \) Parma Chamber of Commerce , Parma \( 1984 \) Parma Sesquicentennial , 1826 1976 Nevertheless , Parma 's national image has been marred by three incidents 1 Such major newspapers as The New York Times covered allegations from the 1970s onwards that Parma 's government worked to resist racial integration Former Parma City Council President Kenneth Kuczma famously said , I do not want Negroes in the city of Parma , and even federal courts ruled on the matter Parma City Council President makes national headlines for racism URL Accessed June 25 , 2006 2 In 2003 , Parma made national news after a 345 kV transmission line failed in the city due to a tree , which played a significant role in the early stages of the 2003 North America blackout 3 More recently Parma has been plagued by negative press in the local media as a result of perhaps widespread political corruption associated with a group of politicians known as the Good Old Boys or the Parma Machine In order to distract from their own suspect activities , these politicians apparently concocted a Witch Hunt that wrongfully scapegoated innocent police officers Ultimately , investigator Dick DiCicco wrote in his official reporter that there was no evidence presented to substantiate the allegation that officers were taking turns calling in sick in order that other officers could earn overtime to maintain minimums , there was no actual duplicate billing concerning officers Kuchler and Robertson as indicated in The Plain Dealer articles , and based on the review of the above activity no specific pattern of reciprocity was detected on the part of Officer Mekruit On page B2 of The Plain Dealer , Joe Wagner quoted Prosecutor Michael Nolan as reportedly declaring that Mayor DePiero and Council President Germana removed the police tax request from May 3 ballot as an excuse for , apparently , their own inaction Further revelations about the Witch Hunt \( also referred to as the Blue Scare \) , as found in such newspaper articles as Report clears Parma police in payroll padding probe , and including the highly questionable retroactive appointment of a special prosecutor who had been prosecuting \( in violation of the Ohio Revised Code \) select police union representatives who had raised concerns about possible political corruption , has led to calls for the resignations of many members of the current mayoral administration and city council On March 11 , 2005 , The Plain Dealer quoted Councilwoman Stys who summed up the investigation as a sham Statements uttered by the mayor in the local newspaper in 2003 that heads will roll along with the press report of an email sent to the mayor by one of his top advisers who referred to Parma as a fiefdom and himself as a samurai has further fanned the fires of distrust amongst residents for anyone responsible for the costly misadventure that to many has seemingly ruined Parma 's image The long term consequences of the crisis , which lasted for nearly four
