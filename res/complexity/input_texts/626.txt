Cosmetic Act \( the Act \) 21 U S C 321 \( g \) \( 1 \) Flora made twelve unfounded health claims about the purported benefits of noni juice as a medical product , in effect causing the juice to be evaluated as a drug Under the Act , this necessitates all safety and clinical trial evidence for the juice providing such effects in humans The FDA letter also cited 1 \) absent scientific evidence for health benefits of noni phytochemicals , scopoletin and damnacanthal , neither of which has been confirmed with biological activity in humans , and 2 \) lack of scientific foundation for health claims made by two proponents of noni juice , Dr Isabella Abbot and Dr Ralph Heinicke Two other FDA letters have been issued for the same types of violationsNoni Tahitian PlusCyber Warning Letter In the European Union , after safety testing on one particular brand of noni juice \( Tahitian Noni \) , approval was granted in 2002 as a novel food by the European Commission for Health and Consumer Protection Directorate General In their report , the European Commission 's Scientific Committee made no endorsement of health claims No noni products have achieved sufficient scientific foundation for being licensed as medicines or therapies Companies today must still apply to the European Commission for Health and Consumer Protection Directorate General to have their own brand of noni juice included as a novel food under the initial approval Health and research issues In 2005 , two scientific publications described incidents of acute hepatitis caused by ingesting noni One study suggested the toxin to be anthraquinones , found in roots , leaves and fruit of the noni , while the other named juice as the delivery method This was , however , followed by a publicationWorld J Gastroenterol showing that noni juice 1 \) was not toxic to the liver even when consumed in high doses , and 2 \) contained low quantities of anthraquinones which are potentially toxic to liver tissue The case reports of hepatitis were reviewed by the European Food Safety Authority \( EFSA \) , wherein it was concluded that no causal link could be established EFSA EFSA re assesses safety of noni juice The

MayoClinic comNoni Juice Can It Lower Cholesterol \? Laboratory studies have investigated noni 's effect on the growth of cancerous tissue in mice One such study in vitro found that noni reduced growth of capillary vessels sprouting from human breast tumor explants and , at increased concentrations , caused existing vessels to degenerate It remains unknown whether such effects occur in vivo in other animal models or in cancer patients Another study showed noni juice to inhibit formation of cancer cells in rats \( using detection methods of biochemical markers called DNA adducts \) It further showed a reduced number of DNA adducts in rats induced with a carcinogen The same study showed effective antioxidant properties of noni juice compared with those of vitamin C , grape seed powder , and pycnogenol The results indicated reduced carcinogen DNA adduct formation in this laboratory model and antioxidant activity that may be relevant to anti cancer mechanisms As such findings have neither been confirmed by other laboratory experiments nor demonstrated in expert reviewed human clinical trials , no inference can be made about whether noni has anti cancer properties Laboratory experiments showed that noni juice may affect physical endurance of mice Ma DL , West BJ , Su CX , Gao JH , Liu TZ , Liu YW Evaluation of the ergogenic potential of noni juice Phytotherapy Research 2007 Nov 21 \( 11 \) 1100 1101 A preliminary study of athletes showed potential benefit of noni juice on exercise endurance , an effect the authors attributed to increased antioxidant capacity Palu AK , Seifulla RD , West BJ Morinda citrifolia L \( noni \) improves athlete endurance Its mechanisms of action Journal of Medicinal Plant Research 2 \( 7 \) 154 158 References Further reading Category Juice
