The Goguryeo controversies refers to the disputes between China and Korea on the history of Goguryeo , an ancient kingdom located mostly in the present day Northeast China and North Korea In 2004 this dispute threatened to lead to diplomatic disputes between China and both Koreas when China formalized this view into a government project Background Goguryeo has been conventionally viewed as one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea Chinese characterization of Goguryeo as a regional power of China in modern times has spawned heated disputes with both North Korea and South Korea who claim Goguryeo was an independent Korean state At heart of the Goguryeo controversy is whether Goguryeo was a part of the greater Chinese nation , or an independent Korean kingdom Starting from the 1980s when the PRC constitution was amended to redefine the People 's Republic of China as a unitary multinational state built up jointly by the people of all its nationalities , some Chinese historians began to re identify Goguryeo , especially the first half of Goguryeo 's history before it moved its capital to the Korean peninsula , as part of the regional history of China rather than of Korea Byington , Mark The Creation of an Ancient Minority Nationality Koguryo in Chinese Historiography In Embracing the Other The Interaction of Korean and Foreign Cultures Proceedings of the 1st World Congress of Korean Studies , III Songnam , Republic of Korea The Academy of Korean Studies , 2002 This historical revisionism was intensified in the 1990s when a head historian of a North Korean delegation accused Chinese historians of conceiving of ancient China in terms of the territorial bounds of the modern Chinese state , which , he claimed , is a view unsupported by historical evidence More recently in 2002 , this effort has been taken up by the PRC government in the form of the Northeast Project Chinese scholars perceive the Korean nationalistic sentiments of some Koreans in both North and South Koreas as threatening to its territorial integrity In fact , some Korean ultra nationalists in both the Korean liberal and conservative camps make claims for the restoration of the lost former

Manchuria , China fears that they might secede from China and join a newly unified Korea The War of Words Between South Korea and China Over An Ancient Kingdom Why Both Sides Are Misguided China may be making claims to Goguryeo to validate their control over current Chinese land Meanwhile , North Korea has glorified Goguryeo 's independent qualities as part of their Juche \( self reliance \) ideology , identifying itself with Goguryeo , while equating South Korea with Silla , and the United States with Tang North Korea has distorted their national history to conform it to Juche , by denying any indication of foreign occupation of the Korean peninsula , such as the existence of any Chinese commanderies there Nevertheless , North Korea tries to be relatively silent , due to its political and economic dependence on China During the 19th and 20th Centuries , the Japanese Empire also differentiated Goguryeo from the other Three Kingdoms of Korea to highlight Japanese \( Wa \)

legitimacy of the Northeast Project , generally making these arguments The places that the Four Commanderies of Han occupied were originally places of native Korean people The Chinese commanderies were later driven out by Goguryeo , one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea A state established in what is now China does not necessarily mean it is Chinese For example , during Yuan Dynasty , the whole China became part of the Mongol Empire With no doubt , this is part of History of Mongolia Besides , Goguryeo 's territories included land in both Manchuria and the Korean peninsula Goguryeo 's second capital was located at Pyongyang , North Korea Before the capital city was moved , Goguryeo territory comprised what is today North Korea and parts of Manchuria Goguryeo is a country founded by Buyeo people , one of the major ancestors of Korean people Both Goguryeo and Baekje are successor nations of Buyeo The fact that large numbers of Goguryeo people were assimilated into China does not necessarily make it Chinese as many were also assimilated into other dynasties at the time Discovered of Goguryeo \( \) , Written on South Korea historian Kim Yong man Approximately 30 , 000 Goguryeo households were assimilated to China This is insignificant when looking at the fact that Goguryeo listed more than 700 , 000 households China had not absorbed a significant amount of Goguryeo 's total population Balhae received the most Goguryeo immigrants Its founder was a Goguryeo noble When the Khitans invaded Balhae , the majority population fled to Goryeo Goguryeo lasted about 700 years while no Chinese dynasty concurrent with Goguryeo 's rule lasted for more than 500 years It was Imperial China 's tributary only during some of its existence More important , being a tributary of Imperial China does n't make it Chinese Many East Asia dynasties and kingdoms , like Sila , Goryeo , Japan , Ryukyu etc , had tributary relationships with Chinese Dynasties during some time of their existence Many of the customs \( Ssireum , Taekwondo , ondol , dancing etc \) depicted in the murals are present in some form in Korean culture today The name Korea has its roots from the name Goryeo , which in turn took its name from Goguryeo Goryeo is the more correct term for the Goguryeo dynasty as Goguryeo is mainly referred to Goryeo in most Chinese and Japanese historic texts after the reign of King Jangsu of Goguryeo Goguryeo is also stated as Goryeo on the Gwanggaeto Stele The dynasty Goryeo was founded on the basis that it was the descendant dynasty of Goguryeo , therefore adopting the name of Goguryeo Only Southern Koreans from the Jeolla and Gyeongsang regions were descendants of Samhan , which is south of the Geum River There are more Koreans descended from inhabitants outside Samhan and Silla , i e , north of Geum River Many Koreans are descendants of people outside Samhan \( especially people that have families originated from Norther Korea \) , ie Goguryeo , but we cannot state that the North Koreans are Chinese while they share the same language and culture with South Korea The view that Goguryeo is Chinese contradicts with Chinese history records of the past Chinese dynasties and the world academia of history Northeast China Project is politics under the cover of academics , fearing that the possible unification of North and South Korea may cause border disputes between Korea and China Criticism China revealed its claims on Goguryeo in 2002 with the Northeast China project In 2003 , they tried to incorporate Goguryeo tombs in China as their own Wei Chunchung , a professor , declared that Goguryeo was established by Chinese ethnic groups 02Gries pmd South Korea soon found out that China deleted mentions of Goguryeo in its government website This caused an outrage in South Korea From other countries The PRC 's revision of Goguryeo history , in an attempt to recharacterize it as a Chinese provincial state rather than an independent Korean kingdom , has received international criticism for making a flawed and politically motivated rewriting of history Such criticisms came from numerous scholars from other countries such as the United States , Russia , Mongolia , and Australia , China shock for South Korea By Bruce Klingner Asia Times including Goguryeo historians such as Mark Byington , indicated by an e mail sent when completing a postdoctoral program at the Korea Institute , an autonomous non departmental entity physically located at Harvard University Harvard University Korea Institute and R Sh Djarylgashinova of Russian Academy of Science Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography Mark Byington believes that China 's claims are flimsy and do not have much weight when their arguments are analyzed From Korea Peter Gries noted that after UNESCO granted both China and North Korea 's applications for world heritage status , Chinese websites subsequently consistently referred to it as China 's Koguryo , which became a popular issue in South Korea , exhibited in editorials and op eds Furthermore , Gries quoted Kim Woo Jun , a history professor , as suggesting that the events might shift South Korea 's strategy from being anti U S , pro China to anti China , pro U S Yonson Ahn , a Korean researcher noted for her work on Korean women 's issues The Korea China Textbook War What 's It All About \? , writes that historians such as Quan Zhezhu , Sun Jinji , Kim Hui kyo , and Mark Byington perceive the launching of the Project as a defensive reaction to preserve China s own territorial integrity and stability North Korea 's state run media has denounced Chinese claims as a pathetic attempt to manipulate history for its own interests or intentionally distorting historical facts through biased perspectives in North Korean media north korea teaching english in at freenorthkorea net In 2004 , in an effort to prevent the issue from weakening bilateral ties with South Korea , China promised to not assert claims over Goguryeo and also pledged to not distort Goguryeo history in its textbooks Skepticism Lingers over History Issue Jo Beop jong , a professor at Woosuk University in South Korea , said China may not correct the distorted history about Goguryeo because if Beijing admits Goguryeo as Korean history , China must give up its Northeast Asia project From China The Northeast Project is not universally accepted in the PRC In 2006 , in an interview with the Chosun Ilbo , a senior scholar from Peking University affirmed Goguryeo as a part of Korean history He has expressed disagreement with the CASS institute , the PRC government institution running the Northeast Project , and indirectly criticized the project on behalf of the Peking University Department of History See also China South Korea relations
