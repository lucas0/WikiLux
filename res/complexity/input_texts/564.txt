was dropped by Crown prosecutors before going to trial Singh was one of 51 people to file a complaint against the conduct of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police \( RCMP \) at the APEC summit that sparked a formal investigation by the Commission for Public Complaints Against the RCMP In March 2000 , he was one of three people to formally withdraw from the inquiry , alleging that Prime Minister Jean Chr tien 's rejection of an invitation to testify before the Commission was proof that the process was flawed In one of the findings condemning RCMP behavior issued in the final report by the Commission , it was noted that Mr Jaggi Singh was arrested on a warrant based on a spurious charge the manner of his arrest was inappropriate in the circumstances the timing of the arrest was calculated to prevent him from attending protests on November 25 the bail conditions sought were overly restrictive G 20 the Quebec City Summit of the Americas Singh would continue to attend Canadian rallies and protests , and continued to face arrests In October 2000 , he was arrested at a G 20 protest in Montreal , and charged with participation in a riot , and illegal assembly and mischief Police claimed that Jaggi s speech against the International Monetary Fund incited the crowd , and that he announced the availability of medical help while riot police were charging at the crowd In April 2003 , he was acquitted of the riot charges Singh gained widespread notoriety as the longest detained demonstrator arrested by police at the Quebec City Summit of the Americas Witnesses reported that , he was grabbed from behind by police masquerading as protesters and dragged away in a beige van Singh was held for a total of 17 days , and charged with breaking conditions from previous arrests and with weapons charges for a mock catapult that launched teddy bears that was actually constructed and operated by an unrelated group from Edmonton , which released a satirical statement

States He was released on 3 , 000 bail with conditions that prohibited him from leading or organizing any demonstrations or using a megaphone In a telephone interview conducted while he was in the Orsainville jail near Quebec , Singh explained his view that legal action against him and other political activists was designed to intimidate them into silence , and split them off from mainstream public opinion 250px left thumb Protesters carrying a mock catapult at the Quebec City Summit of the Americas During the lengthy pre trial process , the weapons charge was dropped , and Singh s request in November 2003 for a stay of proceedings based on unreasonable delay and abuse of process , was accepted two months before the case would have gone to trial in January 2004 In his ruling , Judge Beaulieu of the Quebec Superior Court agreed with Singh s position that the bail conditions imposed on May 2001 have restrained his right to freedom , opinion , expression and the right of freedom of association as protected by article 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Pro Palestinian activism Singh is also known for his pro Palestinian activism and for organizing protests in and around Montreal On September 9 , 2002 , he participated in a protest against a speech by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu which was to be presented by the pro Israel Hillel club at Concordia University , with support from the Asper Foundation The talk was canceled when confrontations between protestors , police and security agents became violent , resulting in widespread coverage in the media , including an article in The Globe and Mail written by Singh himself In January 2003 , Singh was deported by Israeli authorities after having gone to the West Bank on an invitation from the International Solidarity Movement He had initially been denied entrance to the country upon his arrival in December 2002 , but fought the decision in court Though he won the right to stay for three weeks , he was barred from visiting the West Bank Singh refused to abide by the order and made public his reasons for doing so , writing It 's not for an occupying power to decide who can or ca n't enter Palestine I 've decided then to ignore the Israeli security services and listen to the Palestinian activists It was an easy choice to make On January 8 , 2003 , Singh was nabbed by undercover police officers in Jerusalem He was held at the Russian Compound and then the Maasiyahu Prison , before being deported back to Canada On January 20 , 2003 , Singh was to speak at a demonstration in support of students facing disciplinary charges for the September 9 protest against Benjamin Netanyahu He was arrested on university campus by police and charged with illegal assembly , obstruction , mischief , assault , conspiracy and breaking prior conditions , for the September 9 protest Singh mounted his own defense and filed an abuse of process motion after the prosecution failed to disclose more than 30 unedited videos taken by surveillance cameras the day of the protest He put it to the court that the videos showed inconsistencies with the evidence given by security guards and supported his version of events In his ruling , Montreal Municipal Court Judge Pierre Fontaine wrote that the Concordia University Administration had exhibited gross negligence that amounted to a flagrant violation of Singh 's right to a fair trial The dismissal of the charges at that time meant that Singh enjoyed his first totally clean judicial record in years The Crown successfully appealed Judge Fontaine 's decision and the charges were reinstated In his judgement rendered on August 23 , 2006 , Superior Court of Quebec Judge James Brunton wrote the trial judge erred when he held that officials of Concordia University were grossly negligent in not volunteering the production of the videocassettes before receiving a subpoena duces tecum during the motion hearing My reading of the transcripts leads me to the exact opposite conclusion Officials of Concordia were exemplary in their co operation with the prosecution and the Court They were exemplary in their dealings with the Respondent during the hearing of the motion On April 19 , 2006 , Singh was attending a pro Palestinian poetry reading music fundraising event , organized by Sumoud at the El Salon cafe , when he was arrested by Montreal police Reports conflict as to what happened exactly Police say they were responding to an allegation of assault reported by a taxi driver outside the cafe They say they attempted to question Singh about the alleged assault and pursued him inside the cafe to do so , but that many of the 70 people in attendance attempted to obstruct them Singh says the man who police say was a taxi driver was wearing a suit and driving an unmarked SUV He says that the man pushed him after Singh asked him what he was doing parked on the side of the road wearing an earpiece Police ended up charging Singh and one other person with obstruction , and three others were given municipal fines Media portrayal in United States In 2004 , the New York Daily News drew reference to Singh in an article about protesters against the Republican National Convention The article incorrectly spoke of Singh being Muslim \( he was born to a Sikh father and Catholic mother \) , prone to violence , that he was proficient in firearms and received training from Kazi Toure , and that the teddy bear launching catapult of the Quebec Summit of the Americas had instead launched molotov cocktails At the same time , the New York Post published a photo of someone they alleged to be Singh shooting off a handgun Singh does not readily throw himself into the spotlight due to an awareness of how the media likes to develop cults of personality I did n't choose to be covered in the way I have been I 've said no to interviews far more often than I 've said yes In 2001 , when the CBC 's The Fifth Estate aired a documentary profile of Singh , it was difficult to get his cooperation Anna Maria Tremonti , the show 's host , noted that Often , people clamour to get in front of a microphone But Jaggi did n't clamour Singh does acknowledge that not all his dealings with the media have been bad There are some journalists who are willing to take time on a story That does n't mean days , it just means making a couple of calls and getting all the background information so the story is not exploitative He was interviewed and included in a PBS documentary Commanding Heights about the global political economy Of free trade agreements , like NAFTA , he says We are not here to negotiate the terms of our own misery Other activism Civil liberties Montreal Police tactics Singh provided an activist arrest and trial calendar to the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in support of a complaint filed by La Ligue des droits et libert s , outlining heavy handed Montreal police tactics that had resulted in 2 , 000 arrests between 1999 and 2004 In November 2005 , the UN body 's report singled out Montreal police for the disproportionate use of mass arrests , stating The State party should ensure that the right of persons to peacefully participate in social protests is respected , and ensure that only those committing criminal offences during demonstrations are arrested The Committee also invites the State party to conduct an inquiry into the practices of the Montreal police forces during demonstrations , and wishes to receive more detail about the practical implementation of article 63 of the Criminal Code relating to unlawful assembly Singh cited the results of the report as a vindication for Montreal activists The report validates what protesters have been saying about these protests , that these mass arrests are essentially a tactic by Montreal police to prevent by fear the involvement of young people who take to the streets in protest Migrant rights advocacy In talks at Concordia University and McGill University of Montreal , Singh has outlined the links between global apartheid and the work of groups like No One Is Illegal towards protecting the rights of refugee claimants in Canada and migrants around the world He has said that , You ca n't define human beings as illegal , as exploitable or as non status He has also criticized the high bar for refugee status in Canada saying that , You have to prove that there is a gun to your head or there will be a gun to your head , in order to be allowed to stay Singh also took part in a protest of Immigration Minister Monte Solberg 's speech at the annual meeting of Citizens for Public Justice in 2006 , demanding a moratorium on all deportations of refugees He was one of about a dozen protestors whose presence was cited as a disruption of the event , and which resulted in Solberg cancelling his speech and leaving the hall Singh currently produces No One Is Illegal Radio , which is broadcast on CKUT and podcasted by the A Infos Radio Project Protesting Canadian involvement in the War in Afghanistan On November 24 , 2006 , Singh was arrested yet again and charged with violating earlier bail conditions for taking part in a 15 person protest against Canadian involvement in the war on Afghanistan at a press conference convened by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper at the Montreal General Hospital The arresting officer s report stated that the RCMP asked Singh to leave based on his reputation as a political dissident and that he was arrested for refusing to leave after being asked to by hospital security At the bail hearing , the prosecution argued for denial of bail on the basis that Singh s history of arrests made it likely that he would re offend In his defense , Singh stated that , I was targeted not for what I did , but for my reputation , and further pointed out that he had won five of the six cases previously brought against him Singh submitted that , Standing up and asking a question is not illegal Standing up and challenging the Prime Minister s policies is not illegal Municipal Court Judge Pascal Pillarella ruled that Singh had not actually violated the conditions of his earlier bail and should not have to spend months in jail awaiting trial Singh was released on 2000 bail , and his trial for charges including obstruction and assault was scheduled for May 2007 International Women 's Day 2007 On March 8 , 2007 , Singh attended a demonstration for International Women s Day in Montreal where he was again arrested by police He was held in jail for five days At the bail hearing , police contended that Singh violated a bail condition prohibiting him from attending illegal or non peaceful demonstrations Several witnesses , including a C gep professor and a medical resident at the Montreal Children s Hospital , testified that the women s day march had been peaceful He was released on 1000 bail The judge commented that the hefty bond might work to deter Singh s activism A media alert sent out on the day of the march by a fellow demonstrator describes the particulars of Singh s arrest as follows A judge ruled that the protest was declared 'unpeaceful' by police only in order to arrest Singh The Quebec Court of Appeals upheld a lower Superior Court decision that ordered two Montreal police officers to pay Singh 15 , 000 , and 1 , 000 in damages https montrealgazette com news local news appeals court upholds ruling that two spvm officers falsely arrested jaggi singh G 20
