novels of Trinidad , the bleaker novels of a wider world remade by the passage of peoples , and the vigilant chronicles of his life and travels , all written in characteristic , widely admired , prose In 2001 , V S Naipaul was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature Patricia Ann Hale , whom Naipaul married in 1955 , served until her death 41 years later as first reader , editor , and critic of his writings To her , in 2011 , Naipaul dedicated his breakthrough novel , A House for Mr Biswas , of a half century before Background and early life Trinidad Trinidad is the larger of the two main islands comprising Trinidad and Tobago \( see map above \) It is also the southernmost island in the Caribbean , its western peninsulas an eyeshot away from the northeastern coastline of Venezuela Here , V S Naipaul , familiarly Vidia Naipaul , was born on 17 August 1932 in the small town of Chaguanas on Trinidad 's Gulf of Paria seaboard , a scant ten miles south of the Northern Range He was the second child and first son born to mother Droapatie \( n e Capildeo \) and father Seepersad Naipaul A half century earlier , his paternal grandfather had emigrated from India from a village in the lower Gangetic Plain of the North Western Provinces \( see map \) to work as an indentured servant in the sugar plantations near Chaguanas Some dozen years later , his maternal grandfather would do the same During that same time , other Indians , their prospects blighted by the Great Famine of 1876 78 , or similar calamities , had emigrated to other outposts of the British Empire , such as Fiji , Guyana , and Suriname , risking deathly sea voyages In these places , as in Trinidad , although slavery had been abolished in 1833 , slave labour was still in demand , and indenture was the subterfuge being employed to meet that demand His father , Seepersad Naipaul , however , had been able to carve out an unlikely career for himself By dint of effort and the good fortune of receiving some education , he had become an English language journalist in what was then a largely illiterate land In 1929 , he had begun contributing stories to the Trinidad Guardian , and in 1932 , the year of his first son 's birth , he became the provincial Chaguanas correspondent In A prologue to an autobiography , \( 1983 \) , Naipaul describes how Seepersad 's great reverence for writers and for the writing life spawned the dreams and aspirations of his eldest son In the new world memory of their genealogy , the Naipauls were Hindu Brahmins Their ancestors back in India had been guided by prohibitions , including , most likely , that against eating flesh The new world , however , was to change some of that By the time of Naipaul 's earliest childhood memories , chicken and fish had become honorary vegetables at the family 's dining table , and Christmas was celebrated with a big dinner The sari , the draped female garment of timeless India , was in Trinidad not only being accessorized with belts and shoes , but its hemline had risen slightly in belated imitation of that of the skirt For females of Naipaul 's generation , the sari was to disappear altogether Disappearing too were the languages of the old country Naipaul and his siblings could speak only English At school , other languages were taught , but these were usually Spanish and Latin It was such a changed and changing family that moved to Trinidad 's capital Port of Spain when Naipaul was seven His father was now working at the Guardian 's headquarters Here , after overcoming some of his provincial shyness , Naipaul began to excel at school Education Port of Spain and Oxford At Queen 's Royal College , Port of Spain , where Naipaul attended high school , he continued to excel at his studies Still not quite 17 , he won a Trinidad Government scholarship to study abroad In the introduction to the 20th anniversary edition of A House for Mr Biswas , he reflected that the scholarship would have allowed him to study any subject at any institution of higher learning in the British Commonwealth , but that he chose to go to Oxford to do a simple degree in English He went , he wrote , in order at last to write In August 1950 , Naipaul boarded a Pan Am flight to New York , continuing the next day by boat to London He left Trinidad , like the narrator of Miguel Street , not looking back He however carried with him a baked whole chicken and roti bread made by his mother For recording the impressions he was about to soak up , he purchased a pad of paper and a copying pencil , which a Pan Am stewardess sharpened for him The copious notes and letters from that time were to become the basis for the chapter Journey in The Enigma of Arrival Arriving at Oxford for the Michaelmas term , 1950 , Naipaul displayed enthusiasm , preparedness , and promise He did so at least in the judgment of his Latin tutor , Peter Bayley But , a year on , by his own reckoning , his attempts at writing felt contrived Unsure of his ability and his calling , and lonely besides , Naipaul fell into a slump His family in Trinidad began to worry , and by late March 1952 , plans were afoot for a return home in the summer His father put down a quarter of the passage But the return that summer never came to pass In early April , in the vacs before the Trinity term , Naipaul took an impulsive trip to Spain , and quickly and grandly spent all he had saved Attempting an explanation to his family , he called it a nervous breakdown Thirty years later , he was to call it something like a mental illness Meanwhile , earlier that year , at a college play , Naipaul had met Patricia Ann Hale , a young woman his age , who was studying history Hale and Naipaul soon became intimate With her support , Naipaul began to recover and slowly again to write In turn , she became a partner in dreaming up his career When they told their families , however , the response was unenthusiastic from hers it was even hostile The couple did not stop seeing one another , but increasingly kept their intimacies under wraps In June 1953 , both Naipaul and Hale graduated , both receiving , in his words , a damn , bloody , second J R R Tolkien , professor of Anglo Saxon at Oxford , however , thought Naipaul 's paper to have been the best in Anglo Saxon Back in Trinidad , Naipaul 's father had had a coronary thrombosis in early 1953 and lost his job at the Guardian in the summer Then , in October 1953 , Seepersad Naipaul died By Hindu tenets , it fell on Naipaul to light the funeral pyre it was the mandatory ritual of the eldest son , the highest duty But since there was not the time nor the money for Naipaul to return , his eight year old brother , Shiva Naipaul , performed the final rites of cremation The event marked him , Naipaul wrote about his brother That death and cremation were his private wound 1954 56 London , Caribbean Voices , marriage , novel Through the summer and autumn of 1953 Naipaul was financially strapped , his prospects for employment in frugal post war Britain unpromising , his applications to jobs overseas repeatedly rejected , and his attempts at writing still haphazard and running into dead ends He was feeling the pressure of his family in Port of Spain , which was now expecting the newly minted graduate to help out Working off and on at odd jobs , borrowing money from Pat or his family in Trinidad , Naipaul reluctantly enrolled for a B Litt post graduate degree at Oxford in English Literature , with focus on Spanish literature In December 1953 , he failed his first B Litt exam Although he passed the second written examination , his viva voce , in February 1954 , with F P Wilson , an Elizabethan scholar and Merton Professor of English Literature at the University of Oxford , did not go well He was failed overall for the B Litt degree According to Naipaul 's authorized biographer Patrick French , Wilson was a retired professor who was renowned for being taciturn and socially awkward and that Naipaul blamed Wilson for failing him in Naipaul 's words deliberately and out of racial feeling However , according to Wilson 's ODNB biographers , Wilson retired later , in 1957 , and was , a master of social graces and a witty conversationalist Now indigent , Naipaul moved to London , where he gratingly accepted shelter in the flat of a cousin Pat , who in the mean time had won a scholarship for further studies at the University of Birmingham , moved out of her parents' flat to independent lodgings , where Naipaul could visit her For the remainder of 1954 , Naipaul showed snatches of behavior some characteristic of later years , some not that tried the patience of his ragtag support group He railed against Trinidad and Trinidadians he railed at the British who he felt had plucked him out of Trinidad and left him hanging , without opportunity he took refuge in illness , but when help was offered , he often rebuffed it He was increasingly dependent on Pat , who kept calm and carried on , offering him in equal measure money , practical advice , encouragement , and rebuke , but all the while firmly expressing her love But in spite of efforts made by friends , no gainful employment appeared Then , in December 1954 , Naipaul got his lucky break Henry Swanzy , producer of the BBC weekly program , Caribbean Voices , offered Naipaul a three month renewable contract as presenter of the program Swanzy , on whose program a generation of Caribbean writers had debuted , including George Lamming , Samuel Selvon , the 19 year old Derek Walcott and , earlier , Naipaul himself , was being transferred to Accra to manage the Gold Coast Broadcasting System Naipaul would stay in the part time job for four years , and Pat would remain the critical breadwinner for the couple In January 1955 , Naipaul moved to new lodgings , a small flat in Kilburn , and he and Pat got married , neither telling their families or friends their wedding guests limited to the two witnesses required by law Pat , continued to live in Birmingham , but visited on the weekends At the BBC , Naipaul presented the program once a week , wrote short reviews and conducted interviews The sparsely furnished freelancers' room in the old Langham Hotel flowed with the banter of Caribbean writers and would be writers , providing camaraderie and fellowship Still , for Naipaul , the writer 's life , that fair reward for the long ambition , seemed out of grasp Then , one afternoon in the summer of 1955 , in such surroundings , inspiration struck , and Naipaul typed out in one sitting a 3 , 000 word story based on a Port of Spain memory of a man , preternaturally placid , called Bogart in the story Three fellow writers , John Stockbridge , Andrew Salkey , and Gordon Woolford , who read the story later , were struck by it and encouraged him to go on In five weeks , Naipaul had written his first publishable book , Miguel Street , a collection of linked stories of that Port of Spain street Although the book would not be published right away , Naipaul 's talent caught the attention of publishers and his spirits began to lift 1956 58 Trinidad visit , Cement and Concrete , New Statesman Bibliography Fiction The Mystic Masseur \( 1957 \) film version The Mystic Masseur \( 2001 \) The
