work was concerned with scientific methods , model validation , consensus , dissent , as in 2 books on the often misunderstood history of continental drift and plate tectonics She later focused on climate change science and studied the doubt creation industry opposing it She received her Bachelor of Science in mining geology from the Royal School of Mines of Imperial College , University of London in 1981 She then worked as a mining geologist for WMC \( Western Mining Company \) in outback South Australia , based in Adelaide , SA Starting in 1984 , she returned to academe as a research

Yucca Mountain project , with special attention to model validation Since 2013 , Oreskes has served as a Professor at Harvard University in the Department of the History of Science and Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences \( by courtesy \) Science and society essay Oreskes wrote an essay on science and society Beyond the Ivory Tower The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change in the journal Science in December 2004 In the essay she reported an analysis of 928 abstracts , published in refereed scientific journals between 1993 and 2003 and published in the ISI database with the keywords 'climate change' The essay stated the analysis was to test the hypothesis that the drafting of reports and statements by societies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , American Association for the Advancement of Science and National Academy of Sciences might downplay legitimate dissenting opinions on anthropogenic climate change After the analysis , she concluded that 75 percent of the examined abstracts either explicitly or implicitly backed the consensus view , while none directly dissented from it The essay received a great deal of media attention from around the world and has been cited by many prominent persons such as Al Gore in the movie An Inconvenient Truth In 2007 , Oreskes expanded her analysis , stating that approximately 20 percent of abstracts explicitly endorsed the consensus on climate change that Earth 's climate is being affected by human activities In addition , 55 percent of abstracts implicitly endorsed the consensus by engaging in research to characterize the ongoing and or future impact of climate change \( 50 percent of abstracts \) or to mitigate predicted changes \( 5 percent \) The remaining 25 percent focused on either paleoclimate \( 10 \) or developing measurement techniques \( 15 \) Oreskes did not classify these as taking a position on contemporary global climate change Merchants of Doubt Merchants of Doubt is a 2010 book by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M Conway Oreskes and Conway , both American historians of science , identify some remarkable parallels between the climate change debate and earlier controversies over tobacco smoking , acid rain , and the hole in the ozone layer They argue that spreading doubt and confusion was the basic strategy of those opposing action in each case In particular , Fred Seitz , Fred Singer , and a few other contrarian scientists joined forces with conservative think tanks and private corporations to challenge the scientific consensus on many contemporary issues Naomi Oreskes and Erik M Conway \( 2010 \) Merchants of Doubt , Bloomsbury Press , p 6 Most reviewers received it enthusiastically One reviewer said that Merchants of Doubt is exhaustively researched and documented and may be one of the most important books of 2010 Another reviewer saw the book as his choice for best science book of the year A film with the same name , inspired by the book , was released in 2015 Controversies Oreskes' 2004 Beyond the Ivory Tower essay was challenged by British social anthropologist Benny Peiser , who eventually retracted his challenge , admitting he had only found one paper rejecting anthropogenic climate change , published by American Association of Petroleum Geologists \( see also \) Together with Erik Conway and Matthew Shindell , in 2008 , Oreskes wrote the paper From Chicken Little to Dr Pangloss William Nierenberg , Global Warming , and the Social Deconstruction of Scientific Knowledge which argued that William Nierenberg as chairman reframed a National Academy of Sciences committee report on climate change in 1983 into economic terms to avoid action on the topic Nierenberg died in 2000 but a rebuttal was published in 2010 in the same journal which said the paper contradicted the historical report and there was no evidence that any committee members disagreed with the report the evidence was that the report reflected the consensus at the time In 2015 Oreskes published an opinion piece in The Guardian , titled There is a New Form of Climate Denialism to Look Out For So Do n't Celebrate Yet , in which she said scientists who call for a continued use of nuclear energy are renewable energy deniers and myth makers She cited an article by four prominent climate scientists saying nuclear power must be used to combat climate change An opinion piece by Michael Specter in The New Yorker said she branded these four scientists as climate deniers , and that her characterization was absurd , as they were among those who had done the most to push people to combat climate change In 2015 news outlets published stories about how ExxonMobil scientists had found evidence for climate change but the same company cast doubt on climate change , a conclusion echoed by Oreskes The company criticized Oreskes and invited her and the public to read approximately 187 documents written between 1977 and 2014 She and Geoffrey Supran did so and supported the original stories in the peer reviewed journal Environmental Research Letters in 2017 , as reported by the Washington Post Bibliography Books Why Trust Science \? , Princeton
