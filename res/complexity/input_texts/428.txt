over the Romans at the Battle of Manzikert , the process was accelerated and the country was called Turkey The Selquk Empire controlled Turkey until the country was invaded by the Mongols During the years when the country was under Mongol rule , some small Turkic states were born One of these states was the Ottoman beylik which quickly controlled Western Anatolia and conquered much of Rumelia After finally conquering Istanbul , the Ottoman state would become a large empire , called the Turkish Empire in Europe Next , the Empire expanded to Eastern Anatolia , the Caucasus , the Middle East , the Centrer Europe and the North Africa Although the Empire 's power and prestige peaked in the 1500 's the military did not fully reach the technological advance of the Western powers in the 1800

earliest Neolithic settlements such as atalh y k \( Pottery Neolithic \) , ay n \( Pre Pottery Neolithic A to Pottery Neolithic \) , Neval ori \( Pre Pottery Neolithic B \) , Hac lar \( Pottery Neolithic \) , G bekli Tepe \( Pre Pottery Neolithic A \) and Mersin are considered to be among the earliest human settlements in the world The settlement of Troy starts in the Neolithic and continued into the Iron Age Through recorded history , Anatolians have spoken Indo European , Semitic and Kartvelian languages , as well as many languages of uncertain affiliation In fact , given the antiquity of the Indo European Hittite and Luwian languages , some scholars have proposed Anatolia as the hypothetical center from which the Indo European languages have radiated The Hattians were an ancient people who inhabited the southeastern part of Anatolia , noted at least as early as ca 2300 , until they were gradually absorbed ca 2000 1700 BC by Indo European Hittites who founded the first major empire in the area , from the eighteenth through the thirteenth century BC The Assyrians colonized parts of southeastern Turkey as far back as 1950 BC until the year 612 BC , when the Assyrian Empire

The Celsus Library in Ephesus , dating from 135 AD Starting around 1200 BC , the coast of Anatolia was heavily settled by Aeolian and Ionian Greeks Numerous important cities were founded by these colonists , such as Miletus , Ephesus , Smyrna \( modern Izmir \) , and Byzantium \( later Constantinople and Istanbul \) Anatolia was conquered by the Persian Achaemenid Empire during the sixth and fifth centuries BC and later fell to Alexander the Great in 334 BC Anatolia was subsequently divided into a number of small Hellenistic kingdoms \( including Bithynia , Cappadocia , Pergamum , and Pontus \) , all of which had succumbed to the Roman Republic by the mid 1st century BC In 324 , the Roman emperor Constantine I chose Byzantium to be the new capital of the Roman Empire , renaming it New Rome \( later Constantinople and Istanbul \) After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , it became the capital of the Byzantine Empire \( Eastern Roman Empire \) Turkic migration Before the

American Philosophical Society , Philadelphia , 1958 The main migration \( expansion \) of Turkic people to Anatolia occurred at the same time of Turkic migration between the 6th and 11th centuries \( the Early Middle Ages \) , when they spread across most of Central Asia and into Europe and the Middle East The Seljuk Turks \( Sel uk T rkleri \) were the first Turkish power to arrive in the 11th century as conquerors , who proceeded to gradually conquer the land of existing Byzantine Empire In the following centuries the local population began to be assimilated from the emerging Turkic migrants Over time , as word spread regarding the victory of the Turks in Anatolia , more Turkic migrants began to intermingle with the local inhabitants , which helped to bolster the Turkish speaking population Large number of the Byzantine Greeks living in Anatolia , emigrated or were forced out of the region , returning to Greece , to avoid religious conversion Seljuk Dynasty The House of Seljuk was a branch of the K n k O uz Turks who resided on the periphery of the Muslim world , north of the Caspian and Aral Seas in the Yabghu Khaganate of the O uz confederacy in the 10th century In the 11th century , the Seljuks started migrating from their ancestral homelands towards the eastern regions of Anatolia , which eventually became the new homeland of O uz Turkic tribes following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 The victory of the Seljuks gave rise to the Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate which developed as a separate branch of the larger Seljuk Empire that covered parts of Central Asia , Iran , Anatolia and Southwest Asia Mongol Rule In 1243 , the Seljuk armies were defeated by the Mongols , causing the Seljuk empire 's power to slowly disintegrate During the Mongol , some Turkish principalities \( beyliks \) was founded One of these beyliks , governed by Osman I would , over the next 200 years , evolve into the Ottoman Empire , expanding throughout Anatolia , the Balkans and the Levant Ottoman Dynasty The Ottoman beylik 's first capital was located in Bursa in 1326 After expanding to Europe and Anatolia , in 1453 , the Ottomans completed the conquest of the Byzantine Empire by capturing its capital , Constantinople The Ottoman Empire would continue to expand into the Balkans , North Africa , and Middle East The Ottoman Empire 's power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries , particularly during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent The empire was often at odds with the Holy Roman Empire in its steady advance towards Central Europe through the Balkans and the southern part of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth At sea , the empire contended with the Holy Leagues , composed of Habsburg Spain , the Republic of Venice and the Knights of St John , for control of the Mediterranean In the Indian Ocean , the Ottoman navy frequently confronted Portuguese fleets in order to defend its traditional monopoly over the maritime trade routes between East Asia and Western Europe these routes faced new competition with the Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 In addition , the Ottomans were occasionally at war with Persia over territorial disputes Throughout the 19th and early 20th century the Ottoman Empire began to lose a foothold on its territories , first with Algeria and Tunisia , then Greece , Egypt , Libya and the Balkans in the 1912 1913 Balkan Wars Faced with territorial losses on all sides the Ottoman Empire forged an alliance with Germany who supported it with troops and equipment In World War I the Ottoman Empire was forced into the War , after granting two German warships as refugees On October 30 , 1918 , the Armistice of Mudros \( Mondros M tarekesi \) was signed , followed by the imposition of Treaty of S vres on August 10 , 1920 by Allied Powers , which was never ratified These sought to break up the Ottoman Empire and force large concessions on territories of the Empire in favour of its rival Greece , Italy , Britain and France Republic era The occupation of some parts of the country by the Allies in the aftermath of World War I prompted the establishment of the Turkish national movement Under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal , a military commander who had distinguished himself during the Battle of Gallipoli , the Turkish War of Independence was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the Treaty of S vres By September 18 , 1922 , the occupying armies were expelled On November 1 , the newly founded parliament formally abolished the Sultanate , thus ending 623 years of Ottoman rule The Treaty of Lausanne of July 24 , 1923 , led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the newly formed Republic of Turkey as the successor state of the Ottoman Empire , and the republic was officially proclaimed on October 29 , 1923 , in the new capital of Ankara Mustafa Kemal became the republic 's first President of Turkey and subsequently introduced many radical reforms with the aim of founding a new secular republic from the remnants of its Ottoman past According to the Law on Family Names , the Turkish parliament presented Mustafa Kemal with the honorific surname Atat rk \( Father of Turks \) in 1934 Turkey remained neutral during most of World War II but entered on the side of the Allies on February 23 , 1945 , as a ceremonial gesture and in 1945 became a charter member of the United Nations Difficulties faced by Greece after the war in quelling a communist rebellion , along with demands by the Soviet Union for military bases in the Turkish Straits , prompted the United States to declare the Truman Doctrine in 1947 The doctrine enunciated American intentions to guarantee the security of Turkey and Greece , and resulted in large scale U S military and economic support After participating with the United Nations forces in the Korean conflict , Turkey joined NATO in 1952 , becoming a bulwark against Soviet expansion into the Mediterranean Following a decade of intercommunal violence on the island of Cyprus and the Greek military coup of July 1974 , overthrowing President Makarios and installing Nikos Sampson as a dictator , Turkey invaded the Republic of Cyprus in 1974 Nine years later the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus \( TRNC \) was established Turkey is the only country that recognises the TRNC The single party period was preceded by the multiparty democracy after 1945 The Turkish democracy was interrupted by military coups d' tats in in 1960 , 1971 , 1980 and 1997 In 1984 , the PKK began an insurgency against the Turkish government the conflict , which has claimed over 40 , 000 lives , continues today Since the liberalization of the Turkish economy during the 1980s , the country has enjoyed stronger economic growth and greater political stability References
