The Physicians and Surgeons for Scientific Integrity \( PSSI \) , formally registered as PSSI International Inc , is a nonprofit anti evolution organization promoting intelligent design associated with the Discovery Institute , based in Clearwater , Florida It sponsors events promoting intelligent design and fundamentalist Christianity The PSSI has also created and maintains a list of medical professionals who Dissent from Darwinism This list is used by the Discovery Institute in its anti evolution campaigns The petition is in support of the Discovery Institute claims that intelligent design is scientifically valid while attempting to create the impression that evolution lacks broad scientific support Understanding the Intelligent Design Creationist Movement Its True Nature and Goals A Position Paper from the Center for Inquiry , Office of Public Policy Barbara Forrest May , 2007 The Dissent petition contains a vaguely worded and misleading statement , similar to the widely criticized document produced by the Discovery Institute , A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism , in 2001 This effort as one of the Discovery Institute anti evolution campaigns has come under criticism for being misleading and anti science The list of signatories represents an insignificant fraction of medical professionals \( about 0 02 \) The evidence of evolution is not determined by petitions or polls , however , but by scientific evidence This is the reason that , in biological science itself , the theory of evolution is overwhelmingly accepted 99 9 percent of scientists accept evolution , according to Brian Alters , as quoted in Finding the Evolution in Medicine , Cynthia Delgado , NIH Record , July 28 , 2006 As of August 27 , 2007 , the list included 270 physicians and other medical and related professionals Viewpoint The PSSI claim that academic freedom is being hampered by evolution supporters suppressing views that they disagree with They also attack the standard creationist strawman of evolution , claiming that Darwinian macroevolution is a random process that moves from molecules to man This is incorrect , since natural selection is not a random process at all , and the theory of evolution is silent on the processes by which life began , such as abiogenesis The PSSI website repeats other standard creationist objections to evolution , including the claim that subscription to Darwinian macroevolution \( a misleading nonsense phrase \) is damaging to the social structures of societies This is contrary to the data analyzed in a study published by author and illustrator Gregory S Paul The PSSI tries to emphasize the threat of evolution by using a mined quote from philosophy professor Daniel Dennett , Darwinian evolution is a universal acid it eats through just about every traditional concept and leaves in its wake a revolutionized world view Resources , Physicians and Surgeons for Scientific Integrity website PSSI also quotes film maker and Harvard Medical School graduate Michael CrichtonThe PSSI webpage actually describes Crichton as writer and film maker \( Jurassic Park , et al \) Michael Crichton \( summa cum laude graduate of Harvard
