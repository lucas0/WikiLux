exploits that day passed into legend , recorded in particular detail within John Prebble s book Culloden , first published in 1962 History Origins Origins of the clan 's name There could be several possible Gaelic origins for this name , with bheathain \( lively one \) being one Another possible origin for the name is the Gaelic B nGaelic Place Names of Scotland \( 'Fair' 'White' in English \) , which appears in the name of Scottish King Donald B n the name could be a reference to the colour of his hair'Dh mhnall Donald B n' The Gaelic English Dictionary by Colin B D Mark'Domnall Ban' A Dictionary of Scottish Phrase and Fable by Ian Crofton and or the paleness of his face Donald B n 's epithet is often seen phonetically anglicised as Bane or Bain The first name 'Bean' is also found applied to men from other Clan Chattan families such as Clan Macpherson Bean Macpherson of Strathmaisie \( page 336 \) , Kenneth , eldest son of Ewen Baan \( page 524 \) Historical memoirs of the

son of Bean \) in Dunmakglas \( page 577 \) Historical memoirs of the House and Clan of Mackintosh and of the Clan Chattan , by Alexander Mackintosh \( 1880 \) A third , but perhaps less likely origin of the name is the suggestionThe Highland clans of Scotland their history and traditions by George Eyre Todd \( page 218 \) that the name originated from 'Beann' \( otherwise 'beinn' \) , which means 'top' 'peak' , An Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language , Alexander MacBain \( See page 32 in the 1982 Reprint by Gairm Publications of the 1911 edition \) as applied to the names of mountains such as Beinn a' Chaorainn in Lochaber and Britain 's highest mountain Ben Nevis \( Gaelic Beinn Nibheis \) If the name did arise from 'Beann' then one might assume it was a reference to the height of the person it was applied to An authoritative view on the origin of the name MacBean came from the respected Gaelic academic Alexander MacBain who , in his An Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language , wrote the following words MAC BEAN , G \( i e Gaelic \) McBheathain , from Beathan , Englished as Bean \( 1490 , Beane , 1481 \) or Benjamin Bit tagno s , life 's son , from beatha , life , with the termination agno s , meaning descendant of , Eng ing , now used like the Eng to form diminutives Also Mac bain , Mac vean An Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language by Alexander MacBain \( page 405 , 1982 reprint of 1911 2nd edition \) If one pronounces the name McBeathain without use of the usual English th , but lightly skip over it , as one would do in Gaelic , one can easily see how the name was then written as MacBean , McBain etc However , Alexander MacBain also provided a view on the origin of the name 'Bain' in the same dictionary , which may also support the name 'MacBean' having arisen from the nickname 'B n' BAIN , from G \( i e Gaelic \) B n , white The Bains of Tulloch appear in the sixteenth century variously as Bayne or Bane , with a contemporary near them called John Makferquhair McGillebane \( 1555 \) This last name is now McIlle bh in , Fair gille , rendered into Eng by Whyte whence also McGilvane An Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language by Alexander MacBain \( 1982 reprint of 1911 2nd edition \) Some MacBeans dropped the use of 'Mac' 'Mc' , resulting in the surnames 'Bean' and \( phonetically \) 'Bain' This has understandably caused confusion with the similarly named Bains of Tulloch who were not part of the Clan MacBean \( McBain \) , but were in fact a branch of the Clan Mackay , who had changed their surname to Bain , after a forebear who was nicknamed 'B n' Mackay , Angus \( 1906 \) Book of Mackay \( St Andrews University \) Printed by William Rae , Wick Page 50 History of the House and Clan of

Davidson , whose successors became chiefs of Clan Davidson , members of Clan Chattan like the MacBeans Early History descent from Gillichattan Mor and Clan Chattan History and tradition ascribes the MacBeans as being among the descendants of Gillichattan Mor more commonly known as Clan Chattan Clan MacBean official website The earliest certain record of the name in its more modern form appeared in an old Kinrara manuscript , which names both Bean Macmilmhor and his son , Milmor MacBean Lachlan Mackintosh of Kinrara A Chronicle of the Family of Mackintosh to 1680 \( 'The Kinrara Manuscript \)

Septs of Clan Chattan The Macbean territory lay chiefly in the parish of Dores , as may be seen from the preponderance of the name on the tombstones in the churchyard , represented by Kinchyle and

Chattan in 1609 the Bond of Maintenance of 1664 and finally , in 1756 , the Letter of Authority from the Clan to Mackintosh , to redeem the Loch Laggan estate According to the Rev Lachlan Shaw , the first Macbean came out of Lochaber , in the suit of Eva , heiress of Clan Chattan , and settled near Inverness The MS history of the Mackintoshes says in corroboration , that Bean vic Coil Mor \( of whom the Clan Vean had their denomination \) lived in Lochaber , and was a faithful servant to Mackintosh against the Red Comyn , who possessed Inverlochie , who was a professed enemy of Mackintosh Again the manuscript records that Myles Mac Bean vic Coil Mor and his four sons , Paul , Gillies , Myles and Farquhar , after they had slain the Red Comyn s steward and his two servants Patten and Kissen , came to William Mackintosh , seventh of Mackintosh \( son of Eva \) , in Connage , in Pettie , where he then dwelt , and for themselves and their posterity took protection and dependence of him and his , as their chief This occurring about 1334 , establishes the Macbeans as one of the oldest tribes of historic Clan Chattan The Mackintosh history , referring to the battle of Harlaw \( 1411 \) , narrates that Mackintosh lost in this battle many of his friends and people , especially of the Clan Vean This loss so greatly depressed the Macbeans that I am unable to trace the succession from this period until the time of Gillies , about 1500 The Mackintosh history being referred to above is the Kinrara Manuscript , a new edition of which , edited by Dr Jean Munro has been published by the Clan Chattan Association 15th , 16th and 17th centuries The Clan MacBean fought for Domhnall of Islay , Lord of the Isles , along with the rest of Clan Chattan at the Battle of Harlaw in 1411 , where they suffered heavy losses In the history of the Mackintoshes , chiefs of Clan Chattan , it is recorded that Mackintosh mourned the loss of so many of his friends and people , especially of Clan Vean The 12th chief of Clan MacBean was Paul MacBean who due to heavy debts was forced to give up his lands in about 1685 However , the lands were re granted in the same year by the Earl of Cawdor \( Calder \) to Paul 's son William MacBean in Kinchyle William 's elder son Aeneas MacBean succeeded him , followed by Aeneas 's nephew Captain Donald MacBean , son of his younger brother Gillies MacBean , who became famous as a result of his exploits at Culloden \( see below \) Mackintosh , Alexander M \( 1903 \) The Mackintoshes and Clan Chattan McBain of McBain , Hughston A Brief History of

Kinchyle near Dores on the south shore of Loch Ness The site was opened in 1961 Many of Clan MacBean supported the Jacobite rising of 1715 and as a result many of them were transported to the plantations in Virginia , Maryland and South Carolina However this did not deter Gillies MacBean \( sometimes known as Gillies Mor MacBean \) , second son of the 12th chief William MacBean of Kinchyle \( his older brother was Aeneas MacBean of Kinchyle \) , from fighting in the Jacobite rising of 1745 Gillies MacBean took up a commission as a major and fought at the Battle of Culloden He is said to have been at least six feet four inches tall , and the story goes that during the battle he saw government dragoons breaking through to assault highlanders on their flank Gillies threw himself into the gap and cut down thirteen or fourteen of his assailants , fighting with his back to the wall Iain Breac MacDonald , who witnessed this , recalled that 'he mowed them down like dockens' page 148

MacBean was killed Also at the Battle of Culloden , a MacBean is credited with assisting the chief of Clan Cameron \( Lochiel \) , who was wounded and unable to walk to escape Another MacBean , Aeneas MacBean \( of Faillie \) managed to escape after the battle by repeatedly leaping from one side of a stream to another until his pursuers were forced to give up However , this is unlikely to have been

Edward s Army , by Alastair Livingstone \( Aberdeen University Press , 1984 \) After the Battle of Culloden , the chief struggled to keep his lands and they were sold in 1760 In 1778 Lieutenant General Forbes Macbean was appointed the commander of artillery in Canada Later clansmen William MacBean extraordinarily rose from the rank of private to Major General and won the Victoria Cross for

present chiefs descend from a younger brother of Aeneas and Gillies MacBean , the two elder sons of William MacBean of Kinchyle Aeneas had a daughter , so his heir to Kinchyle was his nephew Captain Donald MacBean , son of Gillies , who left two daughters as his heirs The chiefly line did not continue through any of these daughters , but instead continued through one of Aeneas and Gillies' younger brothers The copy of the grant of arms of McBain of McBain by The Lord Lyon to Hughston McBain as 21st chief \( having succeeded his older cousin Stewart McBain of Glenbain in Saskatchewan \)
