right thumbnail Jeremiah Lamenting the Destruction of Jerusalem by Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn thumb Jeremiah on the Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo di Buo narroti Jeremiah \( the LORD will raise , Standard Hebrew Yirm y hu , frequently misspelt as Yirmiy hu , Tiberian Hebrew Yirm y h \) \( or , perhaps meaning God will throw , cast away \) , \( Arabic Armiy , Armiy \) was one of the greater prophets of the Hebrew Bible and is regarded by Christians as one of the Greater prophets of the Old Testament He was the son of Hilkiah , a priest of Anathoth His writings are collected in the Book of Jeremiah and , according to tradition , the Book of Lamentations Jeremiah is considered by some modern scholars to have written , or redacted much of the Old Testament , as we have it today His language in Jeremiah and Lamentations is quite similar to that in Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomistic History of Joshua , Judges , the Books of Samuel , and the Books of Kings Jeremiah is also famous as the broken hearted prophet \( who wrote or dictated a broken book , which has been difficult for scholars to put into chronological order \) , whose heart rending life , and true prophecies of dire warning went largely unheeded by the people of Judah God told Jeremiah , You will go to them but for their part , they will not listen to you According to the Book of Jeremiah he was called to the prophetical office when still young in the thirteenth year of Josiah \( 628 BC \) He left his native place , Anathoth , \( where Jeremiah was perhaps a member of the priesthood \) and went to reside in Jerusalem where he assisted Josiah in his work of reformation \( Josiah is one of the most famous good kings of the Israelites during his Temple renovation program , the High Priest found a copy of the Old Testament Scriptures that had survived the purges of his father and grandfather Upon hearing it read to him , Josiah tore his robes in grief at the revealed knowledge of the coming wrath of God , because the nation had not been following the Scriptures Josiah subsequently embarked upon a furious assault upon idolatry in Judah , removing the idolatrous priest hood , and restoring the worship of God to Judah \) Jeremiah wrote a lamentation upon the death of this pious king Although it is not recorded in the Bible , Jewish oral tradition identifies it , and it is recited annually on Tisha B'av During the three months of the reign of Jehoahaz , we find no reference to Jeremiah , but in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim , the enmity of the people against the prophet was expressed with persecution , and Jeremiah was apparently imprisoned In his most famous confrontation with Jehoiakim , Jeremiah warned the king that God would roll him up into a little ball , and would throw him out of Judah a prophecy which includes a possible pun on the use of Jeremiah 's name , which means God throws In his various exhortations , Jeremiah made extensive use of performance art , using props or demonstrations to illustrate points and engage the public He walked around wearing a wooden yoke about his neck he served wine to a family with a vow of temperance he bought his family estate in Anathoth while in prison and while the Babylonians were occupying it He remained in Jerusalem , uttering from time to time his words of warning , but without much effect He was there when Nebuchadnezzar besieged the city \( Jer 37 4 , 5 \) , 588 BC , as Jeremiah had prophesied before hand The rumour of the approach of the Egyptians to aid the Jews in this crisis induced the Babylonians to withdraw , and to return to their own land However , this siege was raised only for a short time The prophet , in answer to his prayer , received a message from God , stating that the Babylonians would come again , and take the city , and burn it with fire \( 37 7 , 8 \) The princes , in their anger at such a message by Jeremiah , cast him into prison \( 37 15 38 13 \) He was still in confinement when the city was taken \( 586 BC \) The Babylonians released him , and showed him great kindness allowing Jeremiah to choose the place of his residence , according to a Babylonian edict Jeremiah accordingly went to Mizpah with Gedaliah , who had been made governor of Judea Johanan succeeded Gedaliah , who had been assassinated by an Israelite prince in the pay of Ammon , for working with the Babylonians Refusing to listen to Jeremiah 's counsels , Johanan fled to Egypt , taking Jeremiah and Baruch ben Neriah \( Jeremiah 's faithful scribe and servant \) with him \( Jer 43 6 \) There , the prophet probably spent the remainder of his life , still seeking in vain to turn the people to the Lord from whom they had so long revolted \( 44 \) Some believe he was murdered in Egypt by those angered by his prophecies It is known that he lived into the reign of Evil merodach , son of Nebuchadnezzar , and may have been about ninety years of age at his death We have no authentic record of his death he may have died at Tahpanes , or , according to a tradition , may have gone to Babylon with the army of Nebuchadnezzar Introspection The book of Jeremiah depicts a remarkably introspective prophet , a prophet struggling with and often overwhelmed by the role into which he has been thrust Jeremiah interspersed efforts to warn the people with pleas for mercy until he is ordered to pray no more for this people and then sneaks in a few extra pleas between the lines He engages in extensive performance art , walking about in the streets with a yoke about his neck and engaging in other efforts to attract attention He is taunted , put in jail , at one point thrown in a pit to die He was often bitter about his experience , and expresses the anger and frustration he feels He is not depicted as a man of iron And yet he continues Attitude Toward Jerusalem Priesthood The opposition in which Jeremiah seems to have stood to the priesthood of the central sanctuary at Jerusalem may have been a continuation of the opposition which had existed from former times between that priesthood and his family this would be traceable to Zadok , the successful opponent of Abiathar Jeremiah 's attitude may also have been influenced by the fact that he considered Josiah 's measures too superficial for the moral reformation which he declared to be necessary if the same fate were not to befall the Temple of Zion , as had in days gone by , befallen the Temple of Shiloh \( I Sam iv \) , which had by then become desolate fact the words of this covenant \( ib v 3 \) , which God had given to their fathers when He brought them up out of Egypt In this passage , there is a plain reference to the newly rediscovered torah \( law \) or teaching Just as little justifiable is the theory , which has recently been suggested , that Jeremiah in his later years departed from the Deuteronomic law The false lying pen of the scribe , which , as Jeremiah says , makes the Torah of God into falsehood \( Jer viii 8 , Hebr \) , could not have referred to the Deuteronomic law , nor to its falsification by copyists Rather , Jeremiah is thinking here of another compilation of laws which was then in progress under the direction of his opponents the priests of the central sanctuary at Jerusalem Jeremiah probably expected from them no other conception of law than the Levitical one , which may be seen in the legal portions of the so called Priestly writings , and results from the Priestly point of view Another possible interpretation is that Jeremiah 's prophecies , which included many , repeated dire warnings against false prophets , is that the hearts of the priests and prophets were wrong This was followed by Jeremiah 's prophecies by way of reminder about the good things that God has in store for his people , Israel , including the New Covenant in which God would remove the heart of stone of His people , and would give them a new heart one of flesh , and a new spirit \( the Holy Spirit \) Jeremiah in legend and midrash The Christian legend \( pseudo Epiphanius , De Vitis Prophetarum Basset , Apocryphen Ethiopiens , i 25 29 \) , according to which Jeremiah was stoned by his compatriots in Egypt because he reproached them with their evil deeds , became known to the Jews through Ibn Ya y \( al elet ha qabb l h , ed princeps , p 99b \) This account of Jeremiah 's martyrdom , however , may have come originally from Jewish sources Another Christian legend narrates that Jeremiah by prayer freed Egypt from a plague of crocodiles and mice for which reason his name was for a long time honored by the Egyptians \( pseudo Epiphanius and Ya ya , l c \) In Jewish rabbinic literature , especially the aggadah , Jeremiah and Moses are often mentioned together their life and works being presented in parallel lines The following ancient midrash is especially interesting , in connection with Deut xviii 18 , in which a prophet like Moses is promised As Moses was a prophet for forty years , so was Jeremiah as Moses prophesied concerning Judah and Benjamin , so did Jeremiah as Moses' own tribe the Levites under Korah rose up against him , so did Jeremiah 's tribe revolt against him Moses was cast into the water , Jeremiah into a pit as Moses was saved by a female slave \( the slave of Pharaoh 's daughter \) so , Jeremiah was rescued by a male slave Ebed melech Moses reprimanded the people in discourses so did Jeremiah \( Pesik , ed Buber , xiii 112a comp Matt xvi 14 \) Jeremiah was a popular name in the 1970 's , as well as among the early Puritans , who often took the Biblical names of the prophets and apostles for themselves , and for their wives Contemporary Commentary Jewish Commentator Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote that the book is written as if Jeremiah not only heard as words but personally felt in his body and emotions the experience of what he prophesized , that the verse Are not all my words as fire , sayeth the LORD , and a hammer that shatters rock was a clue as to how difficult the overwhelming , personality shattering experience of being a vehicle for Divine revelation was , on one of the most difficult task ever assigned , and how difficult it was to be able to see , in advance , ones own failure References Friedman , Richard E Who Wrote The Bible \? , Harper and Row , NY , USA ,
