Michael Edward Love \( born March 15 , 1941 in Los Angeles , California \) is an American singer and songwriter who was one of the lead singers and lyrical composers of The Beach Boys , along with Brian Wilson , Carl Wilson , Dennis Wilson , and a school friend Al Jardine Mike Love is first cousin to the Wilson brothers Role in The Beach Boys Love was the lead vocalist for many of the early Beach Boys hits , including Surfin' , 409 , Surfin' Safari , Surfin' USA , Little Deuce Coupe , Fun Fun Fun , Be True To Your School , Little Saint Nick , When I Grow Up To Be A Man , I Get Around , and California Girls His role as lead vocalist subsequently diminished , but included sections of Pet Sounds \( including the bridge of Would n't It Be Nice \) and the hit Do It Again Onstage , Love has always served as the Beach Boys' MC Love also wrote or co wrote many of the Beach Boys hit lyrics , mostly for songs with the themes of surfing and love the band 's early car song lyrics were generally by Gary Usher or Roger Christian , although a lawsuit , the result of which is still controversial , established Love 's composing credits on many of these hits In the late Sixties , as founder Brian Wilson was sidelined by mental illness and drug problems , Love played an increasingly contentious role in the Beach Boys career , and rightly or wrongly , he has often been identified as one of the villains in the band 's story Despite his conservatism in other areas , Love was one of the first pop musicians to become involved in the practice of Transcendental Meditation , through his meeting with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and as a result he accompanied The Beatles and Donovan on their famous trip to the self styled guru 's ashram at Rishikesh in India in early 1968 Love has been a lifelong advocate of the benefits of TM and contributed a song on the subject to the Beach Boys' 1968 album Friends In the late sixties , with Brian no longer touring , Carl Wilson took over leadership of the band \( with contracts reading that venues hired Carl Wilson plus four other musicians \) , but by the early 80s , Love grew to increasingly dominate the band , who fell in line with his desire to play the early 60s hits and record new material dealing with similar lyrical subjects While Love has sometimes been perceived as a negative force in the Beach Boys creatively , there is no doubt that he has on occasion exhibited sound commercial instincts , as for example on his co writing and singing lead on the 1988 US number one hit Kokomo , the only number one the band had that was n't co written by Wilson After the death of Carl Wilson in 1998 the Beach Boys split up , and Love took over the name , touring with no other original members but with longtime member Bruce Johnston and various musicians formerly of tribute bands The Beach Boys were the introductory act in the televised 2005 Fourth of July celebration on the grounds in front of the United States Capitol The Beach Boys performance featured five hits originally sung by Love and was their first Fourth of July appearance there since 1985 While detractors criticize Love for carrying on The Beach Boys name , supporters point to shows such as this as evidence of Mike Love 's dedication to the millions of people who love the hit music of The Beach Boys Pet Sounds Smile controversies Probably motivated in part by anxiety over his replacement as Wilson 's writing partner \( as Wilson increasingly relied on Pet Sound lyricist Asher and , later , SMiLE collaborator Van Dyke Parks \) , Love became increasingly hostile towards Wilson and his new material between late 1965 and early 1967 , a period that critics and fans now widely acknowledged as the most creative phase of Wilson 's career He reportedly led the group 's opposition to the Pet Sounds material and particularly objected to the song Hang On To Your Ego , which , at his insistence , was partly re written and re titled it was eventually released as I Know There 's An Answer However , at this stage Brian Wilson still held sufficient sway to overrule his opponents and the album was completed more or less as Brian had intended Another factor that is likely to have influenced Love 's views is that , while Brian had withdrawn from touring in late 1964 , Love and his bandmates had to perform Brian 's increasingly complex music on stage There is no doubt that Brian 's rapid musical development placed the group in an increasingly difficult position , since they were being asked to perform material that , in the case of Good Vibrations Brian had recorded over a period of many months using the best musicians available While the Beach Boys were of course equal to the task as vocalists , Brian 's intricate arrangements were becoming all but impossible for them to perform as a five piece band Love 's trenchant opposition to Wilson 's new direction came to a head over the songs they were recording for their follow up to Pet Sounds , the legendary SMiLE album , which was begun in mid 1966 but was eventually shelved in mid 1967 Some who have listened to Smiley Smile , the album that was released after Pet Sounds , concur that Love 's pleas to Brian to not fuck with the formula made plenty of sense Love is reported to have vehemently objected to Parks' oblique lyrics , reserving particular scorn for the song Cabinessence During a heated argument at a recording session , Love demanded that Parks explain the song 's meaning Parks demurred and walked out some few weeks later he officially terminated his partnership with Wilson , effectively scuttling the album only weeks before its scheduled release Although Love clearly had a strong personal dislike for Parks' writing he has often said that he was concerned that the band risked losing popularity by abandoning their successful formula Many critics feel that Love 's dogged opposition to Smile was the major reason that Brian finally abandoned it , and that his opposition was motivated in part by professional jealousy , as well as the fear that Wilson 's departure from the Beach Boys' proven formula would cause them to lose ground In a 2004 interview with Mojo magazine , Love argued that he was not opposed to Smile , as claimed , and that he liked and respected Parks' work , but this claim was strongly denied by Parks himself , who wrote to the magazine to protest at what he described as Love 's revisionism and stated unequivocally that Love s hostility to Smile was indeed the chief reason why the project was shelved Love wrote the lyrics to their famous 1966 single Good Vibrations , although the song also has an earlier set of lyrics written by Wilson 's main Pet Sounds collaborator , Tony Asher , which Wilson restored on the 2004 SMiLE version Partly in response to the band 's concerns , articulated by Mike , Brian began writing songs that were easier to perform live , which turned up on the late 1967 album Wild Honey Legal controversies In the late 1990s Brian Wilson went to court to regain his rights to the publishing company , Sea of Tunes , which owned the copyrights to most of the Beach Boys' hit songs The suit stemmed from Wilson 's forced decision to sign over his publishing rights to his father Murry Wilson in 1969 , but when the suit came to court it was found that the contract Wilson had signed was not valid because of the mental problems he was suffering from at the time \( It was even suggested that Murry had signed his son 's name on the document \) Wilson failed to regain the copyrights , but won a 25 million settlement Following Wilson 's win , Love launched his own lawsuit , claiming that he had made significant writing contributions to many Beach Boys songs , including two titles on Pet Sounds and California Girls , and never received due credit \( or the accompanying royalties \) Love won the case , due in no small part to Brian 's statements that Mike 's assertions were correct \( although Tony Asher has unequivocally stated that Love had no input into at least one song involved , Would n't It Be Nice \) As a result , he was granted 13 million of Wilson 's award , and his name was retrospectively added to the writing credits on all subsequent releases of those songs \( Love and Wilson reportedly had no malice toward each other in the lawsuit unable to come to terms , they resorted to going to court to settle matters \) Love has also initiated successful lawsuits against Al Jardine \( mostly the Beach Boys' company , Brother Records , suing Jardine at Love 's instigation , but also personal lawsuits \) for Jardine 's use of the band name Beach Boys Family And Friends in his solo work Most recently , Love initiated a lawsuit on November 3 , 2005 against Brian Wilson and the Mail On Sunday newspaper , arguing that both misused the Beach Boys' name and Love 's image in a promotional CD that was given with the paper to promote the 2004 Smile release , and also arguing that Wilson has misused the Beach Boys' name in other promotions relating to Smile , resulting in loss of income for the band He is seeking several million dollars in damages , and also a million dollars to cover costs of advertising to correct the perceived damage to the band 's reputation Solo career Love has attempted several times to have a career outside the Beach Boys In the mid 1970s he recorded two albums with side band Celebration , including the top 20 hit single Almost Summer In the late 1970s he also recorded two unreleased solo albums , First Love and Country Love , some tracks from which were used on later Beach Boys releases In 1981 he released a solo album , Looking Back With Love Consisting mostly of cover versions , this was neither critically nor commercially successful , and is often cited by Beach Boys fans as the worst release by any band member After that point he confined himself to guest spots on recordings by people like Dean Torrence of Jan And Dean and to rerecordings of old hits released on packages like Mike Love , Bruce Johnston and David Marks of the Beach Boys salute NASCAR and Union 76 Gasoline \( a CD that in fact featured neither Johnston or Marks , but did feature Torrence and longtime Beach Boys sideman falsetto singer Adrian Baker \) , released to petrol stations as promotional items on Love 's own MELECO label However , in 2003 he announced plans for a new solo album , consisting mostly of rerecorded First Love and Country Love material This album , which has been announced under the working titles Unleash The Love and Mike Love Not War \( not to be confused with the Beach Boys bootleg of the same name \) , has been completed \( and bootleg recordings circulate among fans , the consensus of whom is that it is Love 's best solo work , released or otherwise \) , but has yet to find a label or be released External links Mike Love Fan Club Mike Love Lyrics Love , Mike Love ,
