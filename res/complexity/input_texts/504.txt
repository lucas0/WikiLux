although the relationship with the university no longer exists Since its founding , the UNAMitas have evolved into one of the most popular Mexican teams and have gained an international following The team 's blue and gold colors were selected as a tribute to the University of Notre Dame , whose football coaches helped to develop an American style football team at the university The nickname was inspired by Roberto 'Tapatio' Mendez , who coached the team from 1946 1964 and whose motivational speeches often compared his players to pumas The nickname stuck with the public , and ever since all the athletes representing the University have been called Pumas Their home ground is the Estadio Ol mpico Universitario , which was the setting for the 1968 Summer Olympics It has a capacity for 62 , 700 fans and is within the University , allowing it to be very close to its main supporters , the students The Pumas also have training facilities within the University but their main complex is the Cantera , located near the University History The early days 1930s and '40s In the first decades of the 20th century , the most popular sport among the UNAM student body was American football , although association football \( soccer \) was becoming a stronger presence on campus In 1927 , the dean of the University , Luis Chico Goerne , made the first attempt to affiliate a representative of UNAM to the top football Mexican championship of the day , by filing a petition to join the Liga Mayor de F tbol Professional del Distrito Federal The petition was rejected in favor of Club Marte de Morelos By the 1940s , the dean Gustavo Baz Prada assigned the task to prepare the UNAM representative to Rodolfo Butch Mu oz , then player of Club Espa a The new manager formed its new team with members of the student body of the many schools and faculties of the university The UNAM representative joined many university tournaments , with successful results , and Butch Mu oz went on to manage the team for 13 years This prepared the team to complete their later transition to professional status Establishment 1950s In August 1954 , the Club Universidad was accepted as a member of the Segunda Divisi n , in those days the second tier division of professional football in Mexico This achievement was accomplished with the support of the dean Nabor Carrillo and Guillermo Aguilar Alvarez Sr , a benefactor of the club Aguilar Alvarez was appointed by the dean as the chairman of the club On September 12 , 1954 UNAM played its first professional game , an away match against CF Monterrey The transition was not easy after only three years Club Universidad requested a special permit to leave the Segunda Divisi n for a year while they underwent a rebuilding process The process was completed within the year , Hector Ortiz was appointed as the new manager of the club , and a Board of Patrons was formed The Promotion 1960s After eight years in the Segunda Divisi n , UNAM finally achieved its objective and won promotion to the Primera Divisi n Club Universidad won the promotion on January 9 , 1962 by defeating Club Catalu a de Torre n by a score of 5 1 in Ciudad Universitaria At the end of the game the celebration was moved from the stands to the pitch when the fans invaded the field to congratulate their heroes , and carried the players on the shoulders this was the first step towards the consolidation of the club The following day , the team was received and congratulated by the dean Ignacio Ch vez Octavio Vial , the manager that led the team to win the promotion , and the players Homero Villar , Ra l Chanes , Jos Antonio La Esp tula Rodr guez , Alfredo Ech varri , Jos Ruiz , Carlos Gutierrez , Alfredo Tito Zenteno , Jos Luis El Chango Ledezma , Antonio S mano , Jorge Gait n , Guillermo V zquez Sr , Lorenzo Garc a , Carlos Calder n de la Barca , Manuel Manolo Rodr guez , Edmundo El Poli P rez , and Gustavo El Gato Cuenca became important characters in the history of the club Once the team had established itself in the first division , the Board of Patrons took one of the most important decisions in the history of the club , deciding to create a modern youth system to develop new generations of players The legend begins 1970s After two years under the management of Alfonso 'El Pescado' Portugal , the Spaniard ngel Zubieta took the reins of the team In doing so , he opened the door to foreign reinforcements , but he also gave continuity to the tradition of the club of employing players that had been trained in its youth system The first half of the decade was marked by the arrival of three of the most important foreign players in the history of the club the Peruvian Juan Jos Mu ante , the Serbian Velibor Bora Milutinovi , and Evanivaldo Castro Cabinho They arrived to join a solid base of Mexican players such as Miguel Mej a Bar n , H ctor Sanabria , Arturo V zquez Ayala , Jos Luis Pareja L pez , and Leonardo Cuellar In the second half of the decade those same players would give the club its first titles in the top division In the 74 75 season , Universidad won the Copa M xico and the Campe n de Campeones In the 76 77 season , Club Universidad became league champion for the first time in its history That championship was followed by two sub championships This success is often attributed to the new administration that the club adopted in 1975 , consisting of an independent civil association that helped the University to support the club Still , this assumption is near sighted and it does not take into consideration the previous decades of development of new players The culmination of a successful decade for Club Universidad came with the debut of one of the greatest players in its history , and the history of Mexican football , Hugo S nchez Consolidation 1980s In the 1980 81 season , Universidad won its second league championship That season was also the last season Hugo S nchez played for the club In the following season , the Pumas won the CONCACAF Championship and the Interamerican Cup This decade also marked the national recognition of the work performed by the club , and the revolutionary and dynamic style of play that helped Mexican football overall For the 1986 FIFA World Cup , the Mexican Football Federation appointed the manager of Universidad , Bora Milutinovi as the manager of the Mexico national football team Milutinovi called numerous Pumas and former Pumas to the nation team , including Hugo S nchez , F lix Cruz Barbosa , Rafael Amador , Ra l Serv n , Miguel Espa a , Manuel Negrete and Luis Flores This generation of players gave great satisfactions not only to the followers of Pumas , but also to the Mexican football fans Ups and downs 1990s This decade began with one of the most celebrated championships in club history , the 1990 91 League Championship against arch rivals Club Am rica A new generation of players arrived , including Luis Garc a , Jorge Campos , Claudio Su rez , Antonio Sancho , Israel L pez , Braulio Luna , Rafael Garc a , Jaime Lozano , and Gerardo Torrado This decade is , however , considered as one of the least successful in terms of championships and development of players Towards the end of the decade , Hugo S nchez became manager of the club for the first time Success 2000s In 2004 , S nchez led the Pumas to their first championship in thirteen years The Pumas were able to retain the championship later that year , becoming the first team since the Mexican league was split into two seasons to win back to back championships As of 2010 , they remain the only team to achieve this feat Along with two domestic titles , the Pumas were also able to win both the Campeon de Campeones and the Santiago Bernabeu trophy , defeating Real Madrid in the latter , becoming , as of 2010 , the only non European team to win the cup in Real Madrid 's stadium In 2005 , the Pumas reached the Copa Sudamericana final , where they lost to Boca Juniors in a penalty shoot out Domestically , the Pumas struggled after their 2004 success and , by 2006 , were facing the threat of relegation Tuca Ferretti was appointed as manager that year in an effort to lead Pumas away from the relegation zone The stability and discipline that Ferretti brought to the team paid off as the Pumas climbed out of the relegation zone and reached a final in 2007 against Atlante , which they lost 2 1 on aggregate In 2009 , Ferretti once again led the Pumas to a final , this time being victorious against Pachuca in extra time to claim the team 's sixth championship In 2011 , Pumas became champions of Clausura 2011 tournament , winning their seventh championship against Monarcas Morelia Rivalries Universidad has strong rivalries with Club Am rica and Cruz Azul These games are passionate and followed by the whole city There is also a more recent rivalry with Guadalajara UNAM vs Am rica The rivalry with Club Am rica , compared to the others , is quite old and began during the '60s , when Universidad won its promotion The mere fact that both clubs are located in Mexico City generated the right atmosphere to see a rivalry born and grow A few years later Am rica bought UNAM idol Enrique Borja , even though the player had made a public statement that he did not want to be sold to Am rica In the '80s the rivalry grew when Am rica defeated Universidad twice in the league finals , always with controversial refereeing decisions The '90s began with a victory of the Pumas over their rivals in the league finals , although it was actually a tie the first leg was lost 3 2 , and only the second leg was a 1 0 win The aggregate score was 3 3 , but UNAM scored two goals as the visiting team , giving them the edge A new generation of players from the youth system grew up hating their adversaries this decade is also marked by the birth of Las Barras , who supported both sides but had a much longer background story of rivalry This rivalry is often referred to as the most violent of the country , with security measures exceeding those of any other game UNAM vs Cruz Azul The rivalry with Cruz Azul comes out of the fact that both clubs are located in Mexico City , and they have played two league finals against each other as well as many other important matches UNAM vs Guadalajara The rivalry with the Chivas originated recently when Jorge Vergara mocked the Pumas after a defeat The rivalry later intensified when the Pumas and Chivas faced off in the 2004 final , with Universidad Nacional being victorious In 2005 , the Mexican rock group Molotov composed the song Me Vale Vergara , making fun of the owner of the Chivas and proclaiming their allegiance to Universidad Historic badges Past kits First kit
