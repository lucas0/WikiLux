Trial and sentence Nahimana was prosecuted at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda , together with two others who had been involved with the RTLM Hassan Ngeze and Jean Bosco Barayagwiza Nahimana claimed that he was innocent and denied having editorial control of the RTLM broadcasts during the killings I could n't recognise the RTLM of those days from the one that existed before 6 April It had been appropriated by radicals , what are now called extremists , whose way of seeing and doing things I did not share The hate media trials received attention since it was the first time since the Nuremberg trials that hate speech had been prosecuted as a war crime On December 3 , 2003 , Ferdinand Nahimana was sentenced to life imprisonment , guilty of genocide , conspiracy to commit genocide , incitement , directly and publicly , to commit genocide , complicity in genocide and crimes against humanity Hassan Ngeze also got a life sentence , and Jean Bosco Barayagwiza was sentenced to 35 years in prison Despite the sentences' possible impact on freedom of the press , Reporters Without Borders welcomed the outcome of the trial Nahimana , founder of the Radio T l vision Libre des Mille collines \( RTLM \) was convicted for his responsibility as a senior ranking official on the radio starting 6 April 1994 , date on which he no longer exerted any role , according to his French lawyer Jean Marie Biju Duval The Rwandan historian was convicted for having done nothing to stop the inflammatory content of the RTLM radio programmes after 6 April 1994 , as he had , according to the judgment , an authority on the personnel of the radio station Ferdinand Nahimana appealed his conviction , and the trial before the Appeals Chamber opened on 16 January 2007 On 28 November 2007 , the Appeals Chamber reduced his prison term to 30 years The Appeals Chamber overturned some of his convictions , notably those which concerned events that had taken place before 1994 The Appeals Chamber also overturned the initial conclusion that there had been an agreement between the RTLM , the CDR , and Kangura to assist in committing genocide It therefore reversed the charges against Nahimana under Article 6 \( 1 \) of the Stature , but upheld those under Article 6 \( 3 \) namely , those of inciting directly and publicly to the commission of genocide and for persecution as a crime against humanity by means of the RTLM broadcasts after 6 April 1994 In December 2008 , he has been transferred from Arusha \( Tanzania \) to Mali \( in West Africa \) Controversy over conviction A 2010 book written by journalist and historian Herv Deguine argues that the motives invoked in Nahimana 's trial were based on very little evidence except that he founded and was one of the owners of the radio station , exposing arguments and circumstantial evidence against his conviction He concludes his book by affirming that on the basis of judicial proofs , Nahimana should be released References
