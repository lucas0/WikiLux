thumb right Dean Kamen \( b 1951 \) demonstrating his iBOT invention to President Bill Clinton in the Oval Office A timeline of United States inventions \( after 1991 \) encompasses the ingenuity and innovative advancements of the United States within a historical context , dating from the Contemporary era to the present day , which have been achieved by inventors who are either native born or naturalized citizens of the United States Patent protection secures a person 's right to his or her first to invent claim of the original invention in question , highlighted in Article I , Section 8 , Clause 8 of the United States Constitution which gives the following enumerated power to the United States Congress In 1641 , the first patent in North America was issued to Samuel Winslow by the General Court of Massachusetts for a new method of making salt James W Cortada , Rise of the knowledge worker , Volume 8 of Resources for the knowledge based economy , Knowledge Reader Series , Butterworth Heinemann , 1998 , p 141 , , Manufactures of the United States in 1860 compiled from the original returns of the eighth census , under the direction of the Secretary of the interior , Publisher Government Printing Office , Washington , 1865 , p cxcix Salt making was commenced at Salein in 1636 , and in 1641 Samuel Winslow was allowed , for 10 years , the exclusive right of making salt in Massachusetts by a new method On April 10 , 1790 , President George Washington signed the Patent Act of 1790 \( 1 Stat 109 \) into law which proclaimed that patents were to be authorized for any useful art , manufacture , engine , machine , or device , or any improvement therein not before known or used On July 31 , 1790 , Samuel Hopkins of Pittsford , Vermont became the first person in the United States to file and to be granted a patent for an improved method of Making Pot and Pearl Ashes The Patent Act of 1836 \( Ch 357 , 5 Stat 117 \) further clarified United States patent law to the extent of establishing a patent office where patent applications are filed , processed , and granted , contingent upon the language and scope of the claimant 's invention , for a patent term of 14 years with an extension of up to an additional 7 years However , the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994 \( URAA \) changed the patent term in the United States to a total of 20 years , effective for patent applications filed on or after June 8 , 1995 , thus bringing United States patent law further into conformity with international patent law The modern day provisions of the law applied to inventions are laid out in Title 35 of the United States Code \( Ch 950 , sec 1 , 66 Stat 792 \) From 1836 to 2011 , the United States Patent and Trademark Office \( USPTO \) has granted a total of 7 , 861 , 317 patents relating to several well known inventions appearing throughout the timeline below Contemporary era \( 1992 present \) Post Cold War and the mid to late 1990s \( 1992 1999 \) 1992 Spinner \( wheel \) A spinner is a type of hubcap that spins independently inside of a wheel itself when a vehicle is in motion , and continues to spin once the vehicle has come to a stop As an attachment to the car 's wheel , a spinner operates by using one or more roller bearings to isolate the spinner from the wheel , allowing it to turn while the wheel is at rest The invention of the
