The 1917 Russian Revolution overthrew a centuries old regime of official antisemitism in the Russian Empire , including its Pale of Settlement However , the previous legacy of antisemitism was continued by the Soviet state , especially under Stalin , who spread anti Jewish conspiracy theories through his propaganda network Antisemitism in the Soviet Union reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the rootless cosmopolitan , in which numerous Yiddish writing poets , writers , painters and sculptors were killed or arrested This culminated in the so called Doctors' plot , in which a group of doctors \( almost all of whom were Jewish \) were subjected to a show trial for supposedly having plotted to assassinate Stalin History Before the revolution Under the Tsars , Jews who numbered approximately 5 million in the Russian Empire in the 1880s , and mostly lived in poverty had been confined to a Pale of Settlement , where they experienced prejudice and persecution , often in the form of discriminatory laws , and had often been the victims of pogroms , many of which were organized by the Tsarist authorities or with their tacit approval As a result of being the victims of oppression , many Jews either emigrated from the Russian Empire or joined radical parties , such as the Jewish Bund , the Bolsheviks , the Socialist Revolutionary Party , and the Mensheviks There were also numerous antisemitic publications of the era which gained widespread circulation After the revolution The February Revolution and the Provisional Government The Provisional Government cancelled all restrictions imposed on the Jews by the Tsarist regime , in a move parallel to the Jewish emancipation in Western Europe that had taken place during the 19th century abolishing Jewish disabilities The Bolsheviks The October Revolution officially abolished the Pale of Settlement and other laws which regarded the Jews as an outlawed people At the same time , the Bolsheviks were strongly opposed to Judaism \( and indeed to any religion \) and conducted an extensive campaign to suppress the religious traditions among the Jewish population , alongside traditional Jewish culture Pipes , page 363 , quoted from book by Nora Levin , The Jews in the Soviet Union since 1917 , New York , 1988 , page 57 The mission of the Yevesektsiya was to destruction of traditional Jewish life , the Zionist movement , and Hebrew culture See USSR anti religious campaign \( 1921 1928 \) , USSR anti religious campaign \( 1928 1941 \) , USSR anti religious campaign \( 1958 1964 \) , USSR anti religious campaign \( 1970s 1990 \) In 1918 , the Yevsektsiya was established to promote Marxism , secularism and Jewish assimilation into Soviet society , and supposedly bringing Communism to the Jewish masses In August 1919 Jewish properties , including synagogues , were seized and many Jewish communities were dissolved The anti religious laws against all expressions of religion and religious education were being taken out on all religious groups , including the Jewish communities Many Rabbis and other religious officials were forced to resign from their posts under the threat of violent persecution This type of persecution continued on into the 1920s Jews were also frequently placed disproportionately on the front lines of Russian wars in the early 1900 's as well as WW2 As a result , large numbers of Jews emigrated out of Russia to places like the United States Changing their family 's last name during emigration to reduce perceived risk was not uncommon The official statements by Lenin about antisemitism were contradictory In March 1919 , he delivered a speech On Anti Jewish Pogroms Lenin 's March 1919 speech On Anti Jewish Pogroms \( text , \) where he denounced antisemitism as an attempt to divert the hatred of the workers and peasants from the exploiters toward the Jews The speech was in line with the previous condemnation of the

bourgeoisie Mass campaigns against antisemitism were conducted until early 1930s In 1918 , Lenin made a speech specifically against antisemitism In the same year , large scale informative literature on antisemitism was published The campaigns reached their peak from 1927 to 1930 , when Soviet propaganda regarded antisemitism as being spread by enemies of the Soviet Union Plays and films were made on the subject and public trials were held In 1931 , Stalin said in a reply to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency , Anti Semitism , as an extreme form of racial chauvinism , is the most dangerous vestige of cannibalism Information campaigns against antisemitism were conducted in the Red Army and in the workplaces , and a provision forbidding the incitement of propaganda against any ethnicity became part of Soviet law Dmitri Volkogonov , Lenin A New Biography , Free Press , 1994 The official stance of the Soviet government in 1934 was to oppose antisemitism anywhere in the world and claimed to express fraternal feelings to the Jewish people , praising the Jewish contributions towards international socialism Under Stalin Joseph Stalin emerged as leader of the Soviet Union following a power struggle with Leon Trotsky after the death of Lenin Stalin has been accused of resorting to antisemitism in some of his arguments against Trotsky , who was of Jewish heritage Those who knew Stalin , such as Khrushchev , suggest that Stalin had long harbored negative sentiments toward Jews that had manifested themselves before the 1917 Revolution Ro'i , Yaacov , Jews and Jewish Life in Russia and the Soviet Union , Routledge , 1995 , , pp 103 6 As early as 1907 , Stalin wrote a letter differentiating between a Jewish faction and a true Russian faction in Bolshevism Montefiore , Simon Sebag , Young Stalin , Random House , Inc , 2008 , , p 165 Stalin 's secretary Boris Bazhanov stated that Stalin made crude antisemitic outbursts even before Lenin 's death Kun , Mikl s , Stalin An Unknown Portrait , Central European University Press , 2003 , , p 287 Stalin adopted antisemitic policies which were reinforced with his anti Westernism Since antisemitism was associated with Nazi Germany and was officially condemned by the Soviet system , the Soviet Union and other communist states used the cover term anti Zionism for their antisemitic policies Antisemitism , as historian , Orientalist and anthropologist Raphael Patai and geneticist Jennifer Patai Wing put it in their book The Myth of the Jewish Race , was couched in the language of opposition to Zionism Antisemitism in the Soviet Union commenced openly as a campaign against the rootless cosmopolitan \( a supposed euphemism for Jew \) In his speech titled On Several Reasons for the Lag in Soviet Dramaturgy at a plenary session of the board of the Soviet Writers' Union in December 1948 , Alexander Fadeyev equated the cosmopolitans with the Jews In this campaign against the rootless cosmopolitan , many leading Jewish writers and artists were killed Terms like rootless cosmopolitans , bourgeois cosmopolitans , and individuals devoid of nation or tribe \( all of which were codewords for Jews \) appeared in newspapers The Soviet press accused the Jews of groveling before the West , helping American imperialism , slavish imitation of bourgeois culture and bourgeois aestheticism Victimization of Jews in the USSR at the hands of the Nazis was denied , Jewish scholars were removed from the sciences , and emigration rights were denied to Jews The Stalinist antisemitic campaign ultimately culminated in the Doctors' plot in 1953 According to Patai and Patai , the Doctors' plot was clearly aimed at the total liquidation of Jewish cultural life Communist antisemitism under Stalin shared a common characteristic with Nazi and fascist antisemitism in its belief in Jewish world conspiracy Soviet antisemitism extended to policy in the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany As the historian Norman Naimark has noted , officials in the Soviet Military Administration in Germany \( SVAG \) by 1947 48 displayed a growing obsession with the presence of Jews in the military administration , in particular their presence in the Cadres Department 's Propaganda Administration Norman M Naimark , The Russians in Germany A History of the Soviet Zone of Occupation , 1945 1949 Cambridge , MA Belknap of Harvard UP , 1995 , 338 Jews in German universities who resisted Sovietisation were characterised as 'victims of fascism' but of 'non Aryan background' now 'lined up with the bourgeois parties' Norman M Naimark , The Russians in Germany A History of the Soviet Zone of Occupation , 1945 1949 Cambridge , MA Belknap of Harvard UP , 1995 , 444 Scholars such as Erich Goldhagen claim that following the death of Stalin , the policy of the Soviet Union towards Jews and the Jewish question became more discreet , with indirect antisemitic policies over direct physical assault Erich Goldhagen suggests that despite being famously critical of Stalin , Nikita Khrushchev did not view Stalin 's antisemitic policies as monstrous acts or rude violations of the basic Leninist principles of the nationality policy of the Soviet state Under Brezhnev Immediately following the Six Day War in 1967 the antisemitic conditions started causing desire to emigrate to Israel for many Soviet Jews A Jewish Ukrainian radio engineer , Boris Kochubievsky sought to move to Israel In a letter to Brezhnev , Kochubievsky stated Within the week he was called in to the KGB bureau and without questioning , was taken to a mental institution in his hometown of Kiev While this may seem as an isolated incident , the aftermath of the Six Day War affected almost every Jew within the Soviet Union Jews who had been subject to assimilation under previous regimes were now confronted with a new sense in vigour and revival in their Jewish faith and heritage On February 23 , 1979 , a six page article was distributed throughout the cities of Moscow and Leningrad , which criticized Brezhnev and seven other individuals for being Zionist The article contained traces of deep rooted antisemitism in which the anonymous author , a member of the Russian Liberation Organization , set out ways to identify Zionists these included hairy chest and arms , shifty eyes , and a hook like nose On February 22 , 1981 , in a speech , which lasted over 5 hours , Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev denounced anti Semitism in the Soviet Union While Stalin and Lenin had much of the same in various statements and speeches , this was the first time that a high ranking Soviet official had done so in front of the entire Party Brezhnev acknowledged that anti Semitism existed within the Eastern Bloc and saw that many different ethnic groups existed whose requirements were not being met For decades , people of different ethnic , or religious backgrounds were assimilated into Soviet society and denied the ability or resources to get the education or practice their religion as they had previously done Brezhnev made it official Soviet Policy to provide these ethnic groups with these requirements and cited a fear of the emergence of inter ethnic tensions as the reason The announcement of the policy was followed with a generic , but significant Party message While to most , the issue of anti Semitism seemed to be dropped very casually and almost accidentally , it was very much calculated and planned , as was everything else the Party did At this time the Soviet Union was feeling pressure from around the world to solve many human rights violations that were taking place within their borders , and the statement responded to the inquiries of countries such as Australia and Belgium While the Party seemed to be taking a hard stance against anti Semitism , the fact remained that anti Semitic propaganda had long been present in the Soviet Union , making it extremely difficult to solve the problems right away Furthermore , Jewish organizations in Washington D C were calling attention to the problems of Soviet Jewry to American leaders A major stride was made in helping the Soviet Jews on October 18 , 1974 , when Senator Henry Jackson , Henry Kissinger , along with Senator Jacob Javits , and Congressman Charles Vanik met to discuss the finalization of the Jackson Vanik amendment which had been in limbo in the US Congress for nearly a year After the meeting , Jackson told reporters that a historic understanding in the area of human rights had been met and while he did not comment on what the Russians have done there had been a complete turnaround here on the basic points The amendment set out to reward the Soviet Union for letting some Soviet Jews leave the country While the problem seemed closer to being solved , the Kremlin reacted predictably by taking a stand against allowing their emigration and foreign policy be dictated over by the Jews in Washington Andrei Gromyko , the Minister of Foreign Affairs passed along a letter to Kissenger which stated that we resolutely decline such an interpretation , in regards to the opinion that this piece of legislation would lead to more Soviet citizens being allowed to leave compared to previous years While the bill was still passed by an overwhelming margin , the Kremlin felt attacked Therefore , when the United States placed an official limit on the amount of credit that would be allowed to the Soviet Union , it pushed the problem of Soviet Jewry to the forefront of issues needing resolution between the two super powers See also Anti Zionist
