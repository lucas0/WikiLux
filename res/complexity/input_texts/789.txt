Company in 2005 In the book , Z compiles 50 episodes , moments , events , and people from American history that might invoke radical pride Patriotism is \( justifiably \) a dirty word on the Left maybe it s time to take a look back and reclaim what s come before so we can re invent the concept of patriot acts in the name of inspiring new ideas and new actions Critical reaction has been mixed Gregory Elich has called it an incisive examination of the political and social landscape , but others have dismissed it as a Howard Zinn ripoff , as nearly all of the episodes appear in Zinn 's

and essays on a wide range of topics , plus a handful of his haikus Fiction and autobiography Z is a prolific poet and author of short , autobiographical stories Nearly all of them are clustered around a single theme Z 's Queens , New York blue collar past Z frequently brags to readers about his never having graduated from college Some critics also observe an intellectual streak in his writing , especially in the form of categorical attacks against academia In an interview with Nick Mamatas , Z remarked As for scholarly histories and theories , I 've tried but theory often comes off as masturbation Millions are suffering across the globe and no theory has changed that yet I prefer practice over theory Blog entries on how formal education allegedly perpetuates social control are also common Z also writes many short stories and poems , almost all of which are clustered around a single theme his blue collar upbringing in Queens Much of this fiction , however , reflects an enduring fascination with the sexual activities of minority women Confessions of an Accidental Voyeur , for example , describes an encounter as follows She was an overweight Latina , pretty with long hair , and she immediately busted me gawking Her eyes twinkled as she watched me register the reality that she had just given the skinny black guy a blowjob while waiting for the light to change It then describes a moaning Asian woman , riding atop an unseen partner Another poem describes how its speaker opt s for the risky frontal view by walking past this vision of Latin splendor to see if her blouse is having as hard a time as her shorts in the flesh covering business No comparable descriptions of white subjects exist , and thus white seems to function as a normative racial category in Z 's fiction Issues Z writes on a wide array of issues Topics include his opposition to the Iraq war , veganism , the most sordid aspects of American history , and the environment Z remains a staunch critic of Western medicine Included in this body of work is his 2003 assertion that there is no connection between HIV and AIDS In this piece , he cites South African President Thabo Mbeki and Gary Null , neither of whom holds a degree in medicine His work has been included on Roberto Giraldo 's alternative explanations and solutions for AIDS website , along with Liam Scheff 's The Gay Plague Some have also noted Z 's double standards towards the medical establishment He tends to ignore biomedical research that does not support his arguments , such as the charge that cellphone usage causes cancer Simultaneously , he will cite medical authorities who appear to support certain claims of his , particularly concerning nutrition or the neutrality of clinical trials Mickey Z as the anti corporate heroic ideal In a recent interview , Mickey proposed his life as a template for challenging the New World Order I can speak about my personal choices I do n't smoke , drink or do drugs , nor do I sleep till noon \( or even stay up past 10 at night very often \) My organically fuelled body is free of tattoos and piercings , I do not own a weapon or belong to a sect , and I am happily and faithfully married However , while my vices are n't drugs or guns or mysticism or sexual deviance \( well , maybe sexual deviance \) , my lifestyle is far more controversial to the establishment I do n't eat their food or worship their god or accept their government I also do n't visit their doctors or take their medicines or use their deodorants , colognes , toothpastes , etc I do n't have their accepted academic credentials and I do n't drive their cars , engage in conspicuous consumption or create unnecessary waste In addition , I try not to purchase items I know to be made by slave or sweatshop labour In other words , if everyone were like me , the corporate commodity culture would vanish overnight This simple reality makes me far more menacing and radical than I first appear Mentions of Wikipedia Z has consistently refused to engage his critics Critical postings on his blog are frequently deleted He has tried additionally to modify his wikipedia entry , especially sections on remarks that seem to suggest sexual objectification of minority women On December 9 2005 Z responded to the entry about him with a warning label DANGER Self promoting Demagoguery Ahead He has used this reference several times In addition he has linked to an article extremely skeptical of the reliability of wikipedia , At the same time , he has failed to cite factual inaccuracies within the article and noted in a post on his blog I'm more skeptical of the Times than Wiki , I guess
