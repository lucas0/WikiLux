2 The bombing killed 12 bystanders and severely injured many more Barrett had positioned the bomb in a wheelbarrow outside the external wall of Coldbath Fields Prison in the belief that it would bring down the prison wall and allow Fenian prisoners to escape Background At the age of 27 Barrett joined the Fenians , which , in the 1860s , was a political movement that dominated Irish politics and defied the Catholic Church and middle class nationalists who advocated milder approaches Thousands of Irishmen in both Ireland and Britain were recruited into its ranks Clerkenwell explosion The Clerkenwell bombing was the most infamous action carried out by the Fenians in Britain It resulted in a long lived backlash that fomented much hostility against the Irish community in Britain The events that led up to the bombing started with the arrest , in November 1867 , of Richard O Sullivan Burke , a senior Fenian arms agent who planned the prison van escape in Manchester a few months earlier O Sullivan Burke was subsequently imprisoned on remand in the Middlesex House of Detention , Clerkenwell On 13 December an attempt to rescue him was made by blowing a hole in the prison wall The explosion was seriously misjudged it demolished not only a large section of the wall , but also a number of tenement houses opposite in Corporation Lane \( now Row \) resulting in 12 people being killed and over 50 suffering a range of injuries The bombing had a traumatic effect on British working class opinion Karl Marx , then living in London , observed The Radical , Charles Bradlaugh , condemned the incident in his newspaper The National Reformer as an act calculated to destroy all sympathy , and to evoke the opposition of all classes The day before the explosion , the Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli , had banned all political demonstrations in London in an attempt to put a stop to the weekly meetings and marches that were being held in support of the Fenians He had feared that the ban might be challenged , but the explosion had the effect of turning public opinion in his favour Arrest and trial Months earlier , Barrett had been arrested in Glasgow for illegally discharging a firearm and allegedly false evidence was used to implicate him in the Clerkenwell Prison explosion which occurred the previous December In court , he produced witnesses who testified that he had been in Scotland on the date of the incident The main case against him rested on the evidence of Patrick Mullany \( a Dubliner who had given false testimony before and whose price was a free passage to Australia \) who told the court that Barrett had informed him that he had carried out the explosion with an accomplice by the name of Murphy After two hours of deliberation the jury pronounced Barrett guilty One of the trial lawyers , Montagu Williams , wrote On being asked if he had anything to say before sentence was passed , Barrett delivered an emotional speech from the dock , which ended The next day the Daily Telegraph reported that Barrett had Execution Many people , including a number of Radical MPs , pressed for clemency In Fermanagh , Barrett s aged mother walked

sentence Within days of the explosion , the Liberal leader , William Ewart Gladstone , then in opposition , announced his concern about Irish grievances and said that it was the duty of the British
