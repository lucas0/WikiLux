thumb 200px right Tomb where the remains of the B b are enshrined On the morning of July 9 , 1850 in Tabriz , a young Persian merchant known as the B b was charged with apostasy and shot by order of the Prime Minister of the Persian Empire The events surrounding his execution have been the subject of controversy among researchers , and are regarded as miraculous by Bah ' s , who consider him to be a Prophet The B b and one of his companions were suspended on a wall and a large firing squad prepared to shoot When the smoke cleared after the first firing of bullets , the B b was missing Reports continue by stating that the B b was found back in his prison room finishing dictation to his secretary Other sources , which include Persian and European reports , give a variety of accounts , some in agreement with the miracle like Bah ' story , and some indicating a less miraculous event All agree that he survived the first firing squad , and was killed by the second For many years after his death , the remains of the B b were secretly transferred from place to place until they were brought to their final resting place at the Shrine of the B b in Haifa on the middle terrace of the Bah ' Gardens Execution order In 1850 a new prime minister ordered the execution of the B b he was brought to Tabriz , where he would be killed by a firing squad The night before his execution , as he was being conducted to his cell , a young man , An s \( sometimes called Mulla Muhammad Ali \) , threw himself at the feet of the B b , wanting to be killed with the B b He was immediately arrested and placed in the same cell as the B b On the morning of July 9 , 1850 , the B b was taken to a courtyard filled with nearly ten thousand people wishing to watch his execution The B b and An s were suspended on a wall and the firing squad of 750 rifles prepared to shoot B bi Bah ' Account Here is an account which is in line with the common Bah ' view and paraphrased from Release the Sun , by William Sears , a Hand of the Cause of God The firing squad was made up of 750 Armenian soldiers , split into three rows and was under the command of Sam Khan Sam Khan had become increasingly affected by his Prisoner and spoke with him privately telling Him that he was a Christian and had no ill will against Him Sam Khan said If Your Cause be the Cause of Truth , then enable me to free myself from the obligation to shed your blood The B b replied , Follow your instructions and if your intention be sincere , the Almighty is surely able to relieve you of your perplexity The B b and a young companion were suspended from a nail by ropes for execution by a firing squad of three ranks of 250 rifles each a total of 750 rifles Sam Khan , unable to avoid his duty , gave the order to fire When the smoke cleared , the crowd of 10 , 000 persons was amazed to find the B b 's companion standing , alive and unhurt , the ropes severed by the bullets The B b was nowhere to be seen He was found , back in His cell , finishing His business with His secretary The B b then said to the guard , I have finished My conversation You may now proceed to fulfill your duty The guard , remembering the rebuke he had received earlier , resigned his post , shaken to the core and cut himself off from the enemies of the B b Sam Khan , likewise removed himself and his regiment from this duty declaring , I refuse ever again to associate myself and my regiment with any act which involves the least injury to the B b A colonel of the bodyguard then volunteered to carry out the execution The B b was again taken to the execution ground and suspended as before , and a new regiment brought in Again the rifles fired This time the bodies of the B b and His companion were shattered by the blast The bodies were thrown at the edge of a moat outside the city and guarded so that none of His followers could claim His remains Two days after the execution His followers were able to recover the bodies , hid them in a specially made wooden case , and kept them in a place of safety Western accounts These events were witnessed by western journalists Provided below is one source that is attributed to Sir Justin Shiel , Queen Victoria 's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Tehran and written to Lord Palmerston , the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs July 22 , 1850 This can be found in its original form as document F O 60 152 88 in the archives of the Foreign Office at the Public Records Office in London The founder of the sect has been executed at Tabreez He was killed by a volley of musketry , and his death was on the point of giving his religion a lustre which would have largely increased his proselytes When the smoke and dust cleared away after the volley , B b was not to be seen , and the populace proclaimed that he had ascended to the skies The balls had broken the ropes by which he was bound , but he was dragged not literally , of course from the recess where after some search he was discovered and shot His death , according to the belief of his disciples , will make no difference as B b must always exist Quoted in Ferraby , 1975 Shoghi Effendi also prints a large selection of western quotes in his book God Passes By \( p55 \) , however most are unsourced Maulana Another view is recorded by Muhammad Ali Maulana , a member of the Ahmadiyya Islamic Community , in his book History and Doctrines of the B b Movement \( 1933 \) Mulla Muhammad Anis Ali was the only man who was executed along with him It happened , however that when the smoke of musket fire cleared , Mirza Ali Muhammad the B b was not there The bullet s instead of hitting him hit the rope with which he was hung and Mirza Ali Muhammad fled to a closet from which he was brought again Mirza Jani an early B b historian is sure that the escape was due to the fact that he was not yet willing to be killed and therefore could not be killed , but willing or unwilling he had to submit to the same process a second time , and this time was killed Some people see this account as biased in an attempt by the Ahmadiyya community to discredit the B b , so their own figurehead , Mirza Ghulam Ahmad , can be credited with the station of the Mahdi Miller Another documentation was made by Miller , a Presbyterian missionary , in his polemic book The Bah ' Faith Its History and Teachings \( 1974 \) The execution was carried out by firing squads of soldiers , who fired three volleys The first firing party was composed of Christian soldiers , and the second of Muslims In the presence of a great crowd Mirza Muhammad Ali was suspended by ropes from the parapet , and his body was riddled by the first volley of bullets Then a second volley was fired by the same firing squad at the B b , who was similarly suspended When the smoke rolled away , a cry of mingled exultation and terror arose from the spectators for the B b had disappeared from sight ! It seemed , indeed , that his life had been preserved by a miracle , for , of the storm of bullets which had been aimed at him , not one had touched him nay , instead of death they had brought him deliverance by cutting the ropes which bound him , so that he fell to the ground unhurt Had the B b been able to maintain his presence of mind and rush out alive and unhurt among the crowd , the spectators would without doubt have hailed his escape from death as a miracle of God , and would have eagerly espoused his cause No soldier would have dared shoot at him again , and uprisings would have occurred in Tabriz which might have resulted in the overthrow of the Qajar dynasty However , dazed by the terrible experiences he had passed through , the B b took refuge in one of the rooms of the barracks There he was soon found , was seized , dragged forth , and again suspended a new firing party was ordered to advance \( for the men who had composed the first refused to act again \) and before the spectators had recovered from their first astonishment , or the B b s had time to attempt a rescue , the body of the young prophet of Shiraz was riddled with bullets References Gobineau , Conte \( 1864 \) Les Religions et les Philosophies dans l Asie Centrale Browne , E G \( 1893 \) The New History of the B b Cambridge Includes a lengthy introduction , the translation and then appendixes History and Doctrines of the B b Movement , Maulana Muhammad Ali Lahore , India \( 1933 \) Category Bah ' history
