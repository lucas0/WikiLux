Wreck Alley is an area a few miles off the coast of Mission Beach , San Diego , California with several ships intentionally sunk as artificial reefs and as SCUBA diving attractions for wreck divers Wrecks Six of these were intentionally sunk Ruby E Coast Guard cutter El Rey kelp harvester Yukon a Canadian navy ship Shooter 's Fantasy Barge 1 Strider NOSC Tower a research and communication platform that collapsed during a storm P 38 San Diego , CA Wreck Alley Just a couple of miles off the beach at Mission Bay is Wreck Alley It is an area with a number of artificial reefs including 8 wrecks \( officially , more like 13 in reality if you count the small ones \) , a National Oceanographics Communication tower and the Ingraham Street Bridge This area attracts divers for a number of reasons , but what is probably the main reason they would come back is because the lush , beautiful , colorful life that covers the structures This is a bit more challenging than some places , but it is world class diving These are beautiful places , please preserve them and treat them gently The wrecks are mostly a macro world The life is small and delicate The closer the diver looks , the more exotic and colorful life that they will find These different sunken structures make artificial reefs perfectly positioned in the cold nutrient rich currents Filter feeders of every sort compete for room to anchor themselves Most prevalent are the beautiful Corynactis californica anemones , also called the Clubbed Tipped Anemone or the Strawberry Anemone The other commonest specie is the large , but very delicate , snow white Metridium anemone There are numerous other species on the wrecks , including other anemones , scallops , barnacles , tunicates , zoanthids , crabs , starfish , brittle stars , nudibranchs , fish and other species that a diver can find if they look close During the day , some fish of various sizes can be seen around the wrecks , but really not many The wrecks just do n't offer much cover to fish \( We will see about the Yukon \) Also with the number of divers visiting these wrecks , the larger fish tend to make themselves scarce Still , you will see small bass , perch , baitfish and whatnot swimming around , often in groups Look close though and you will see various small fish adapted to living on the wreck itself and in the ecology created by the other life fixed to the substrate These fish are usually camouflaged and have interesting colors and markings At night , it is a completely different story The fish that spend their days searching for food away from the wrecks , come there to sleep There are large sheepshead and calico bass More perch have come back for the night and in places you can even see white sea bass tucked into some nook Usually , I do n't much care about wrecks Often they are dead When I saw the Ruby E the first time , I could n't believe my eyes Its complete covering of brilliantly colored Corynactis Anemones , made it easily one of the most beautiful sites I had ever seen under water Corynactis anemones are usually from one , maybe two inches tall and half that across Their commonest color is a pinkish , but often you will see variations On the wrecks are every color There were reds , pinks , purples , lavenders , whites and even some yellow patches They are called Strawberry Anemones , but there is every shade of red and pink The bodies and the tentacles of the anemones may be different colors as well The anemones grow by lateral division , so they tend to grow as adjacent patches of one colored anemones , with each patch perhaps a foot square The entire surface is patches of different vivid colors There is some overlap and biologists love to study the slow motion warfare between the patches Another interesting dive in Wreck Alley is the Ingraham Street Bridge When Mission Bay was developed and the old bridge was replaced , all it parts were taken out in about 60 feet of water and dumped It is like diving on a freeway and is quite fascinating Some areas of the structure that are more in the current , have an encrusting of filter feeders like the wrecks , but much of it is like most natural reefs with kelps , fans and algaes growing over it Since there is more cover here , there are a lot more fish here than at the wrecks , especially at night It is a good place to look for lobster in the beginning of the season as well Most of the wrecks are well marked with surface buoys These come and go though and at any time a boat may be tied up to the one you want to go to The Yukon generally has 5 buoys on it The easiest and safest way down to a wreck is to follow a line down from a buoy This is a cold water dive \( usually low 50 's to low 60 's , but can get colder \) so that means the diver should have a good wetsuit Visibility is limited more often than not , from 5 to 30 feet While beginners can safely dive Wreck Alley , it would probably be best if they were with someone experienced Even though the wrecks are meant to be diver friendly , only quite experienced divers should enter them at all These can be challenging dives You should not leave the wrecks Often the visibility is poor and if you leave them , you will not find them again There is nothing around them As all the wrecks are within 2 miles of Mission Bay , they are a very convenient dive Most of the commercial charter boats that bring divers to them make two trips a day for 2 tanks on one or more wrecks There are many dive boats that visit the wrecks , perhaps most notable the Lois Ann \( Lois used to make the best cookies \) The Yukon Yukon Canadian Mackenzie Class Destroyer Length 366 Feet 111 Meters Breadth 42 Feet 13 Meters Tons 2380 Built 1959 Hull Construction Steel Date of Sinking July 14 , 2000 GPS Coordinates 32 46 80N 117 17 12W Depth 68 Feet \( Highest point at stern \) to 105 Feet \( Lowest point at bow \) Position on Port side The Yukon was purchased by the San Diego Oceans Foundation for the purpose of sinking in Wreck Alley Volunteers spent an enormous amount of time and energy cleaning the wreck and preparing it as a safe dive site for divers of many levels Holes were cut into the hull so that almost anywhere you are in the wreck , you are near an exit From inside the wreck , the openings to the outside look like green video screens It is the newest wreck so it is the most intact wreck at Wreck Alley Originally it was prepared so that there was one long corridor , called the Grand Promenade , that went the length of the ship along the port side For publicity before its sinking , a large game of Sink My Battleship was held The winner got the privilege of pushing the button that would scuttle the ship Unfortunately , the night before , a wind came up and the ship sank on its own Also quite unfortunately , it fell on its port side , putting the Grand Promenade at 105 feet and making it an advanced dive instead of an intermediate dive as was planned The Yukon was not a cargo ship , it was designed to carry a crew its bulkheads and low decks form a maze of narrow passages and small compartments Be careful A lot of sand and silt has entered the wreck Luckily the silt does not seem to rise easily when disturbed , again , be careful It seems to accumulate where there are more wires and pipes It is a fun and beautiful dive The upper areas are shallow enough for less experienced divers While experienced divers can find all the adventure they want The cannon barrels were removed , but were replaced with street light poles and look fine Life on the wreck is thick and beautiful The Ruby E The Ruby E Coast Guard Cutter Length 165 Feet Breadth 382 Feet Tons 150 Built 1934 Hull Construction Steel Date of Sinking 1989 Depth 85 Feet Coordinates 117 16'36 W , 32 46'02 N Position Upright The Ruby E is the 165 foot Coast Guard Cutter Cyane , built in 1934 in Seattle , Washington and designed for the enforcement of Prohibition During World War II , The Ruby E conducted anti submarine and search and rescue patrols She also served as an escort for convoys , mostly along the West Coast of the United States Sold in 1954 , she served as a fish processing vessel Her last service was as a salvage vessel , named the Ruby E In 1989 , the Ruby E was intentionally sunk as an artificial reef The Ruby E has a number of easy penetration points , but should be entered only with experience and caution The easiest point to enter is the wheelhouse It is fascinating looking out the round portholes Consider the weather this ship braved in her 16 years in Ketchikan , Alaska The other interesting point in the wreck is the engine room You can see the two large diesel engines The heads are off , so you can see the large valve and rocker mechanisms Sold again , the ship was renamed the Ruby E and outfitted as a salvage vessel Her new owners ran into financial difficulties and could not repay their bank loans The Ruby E was seized as a bank repossession and sat in San Diego harbor until it was purchased by the San Diego Tug and Barge Company Unbelievably , she sits upright and intact on the bottom with only the slightest list to the port side All areas of the wreck except the bilge are easily accessible and the wreck is a pleasure to dive The bow of the Ruby E points in a northerly direction and lies in about 90 feet of water The wreck is in good condition and is almost completely covered with anemones and other marine invertebrates The colors are amazing This is one of the most beautiful dives you can make Some areas of the ship have become quite thin over time though A diver should avoid touching the wreck , because they may very well damage it or the delicate life growing on it The El Rey The El Rey was a Kelco kelp cutter vessel that harvested the top three feet of the kelp canopy from Point Conception to Mexico It was capable of carrying 300 tons of kelp As a kelp cutter , it had a very unusual appearance In her 35 year career , she made some 3600 voyages and traveled more than 800 , 000 miles The vessel was retired in 1981 and destined for the scrap yard Instead , the San Diego Council of Diving Instructors and The California Department of Fish and Game requested her for an artificial reef program Kelco donated the retired ship It was cleaned to prevent pollution and prepared to be diver safe On April 2 , 1987 , the El Rey was towed to the mission beach A U S Navy Demolition Team used explosives to sink her She came to rest upright on the bottom The wreck has deteriorated over the years , but the odd shape of a kelp cutter makes it a fascinating dive There are many fish living in the wreck It is basically an intermediate dive , but as those things go , conditions are variable and it can be a challenge Naval Ocean Systems Center \( NOSC \) Tower The NOSC tower is an old Naval Ocean Systems Center \( NOSC \) tower dedicated to oceanic research that was built in 1959 about a half mile offshore One day after a storm , it was n't there anymore Now it sits in sixty feet of water It looks like an oil rig It is now an amazing artificial reef covered in life , particularly thick growths of brilliantly colored Strawberry Anemones There is some fish life as well It is a fascinating dive Because it was knocked down in a storm , it is the only true wreck in Wreck Alley The remains of the tower are covered in every color of Cotynactis anemone There were vivid reds , pinks , oranges , purples and even a mainly white patch There were also a fair number of scallops up to about 4 inches across On the bottom were a many healthy gorgonian sea fans There were huge Pisaster starfish , mostly on the bottom , but some were on the structure as well Higher on the structure were numerous huge mussels up to about a foot long I accidentally broke one open and the fish went nuts This is a beautiful dive Ingraham Street Bridges The Ingraham Street Bridges spanned Mission Bay When they were replaced in 1985 the old bridge pilings and roadway were dumped in the Wreck Alley area These were huge pieces of bridge , roadway , railings and pillars , all jumbled together It is beautiful diving There were lots of fish and various crawling critters as well There were also lots of clumps of strawberry colored Corynactis anemones on the lower sections of the reef and on the top flat sections , pink and brown Gorgonian sea fans grow thick At one point I came up over a large piece of two lane roadway It was in good shape Even the lines on the road were easy to see Of course , unlike most roadways , this one had gorgonian fans growing on it There was a hole in it about six inches across though and as I came to it , a lobster climbed right out of the hole in front of me The Sewer Pipe A bit south of Wreck Alley , sticking west out of Point Loma , is The Sewer Pipe It is covered in rocks so it is like a large underwater break wall that sticks up about 30 feet from the bottom It extends about a mile from shore and is a beautiful , fascinating dive It is covered in golden laminaria kelp and numerous gorgonian sea fans As it has many holes , it is filled with life of all kinds There can be thousands of lobster , seemingly all under legal size It is a dive well worth doing if offered http www diver net seahunt seahunt Diving For The Fun Of It British Virgin Islands In the British Virgin Islands , there is another collection of intentionally sunk wrecks for scuba divers , also referred to as wreck alley , a couple of hundred yards offshore from Cooper Island See
