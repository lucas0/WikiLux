The Catholic Charismatic Rite traces its heritage and apostolic succession through the Old Catholic Church , which cut communion with Rome in 1870 \( 1723 \) They are also a part of the Charismatic movement which is open to the movement of the Holy Spirit in one 's life This is not to be confused with contemporary usage of the words charismatic or Pentecostal The Catholic Charismatic Rite believes in the Apostles' Creed , Nicene Creed , and the Quicumque Vult \( Athanasian Creed \) History The apostolic lineage of the Catholic Charismatic Church of Canada , also called the Catholic Charismatic Rite \( founded on August 15 , 1968 \) , began under the mandate of Pope Clement XI , Bishop of Rome and Patriarch of the West , in 1693 when , Bishop of Condom consecrated Dominique Marie Varlet as Bishop of Ascalon \( in partibus \) and Coadjutor to the Bishop of Babylon , Persia Bishop Varlet in turn consecrated Peter John Meindaerts to Archbishop of Utrecht without a papal mandate , which created a rift with Rome and an end to full communion with the Roman Church Meindaerts was one of the primary founders of the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands , independent from and considered excommunicated by Rome The Charismatic Catholic church also supports the Holy Father Bishop of Rome and all his teachings which never contradict the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the teachings of the Early Church The CCCC is NOT affiliated with the Old Catholic Church or any independent Catholic movement Due to the majority of ministers of these sects that are causing division and teaching strange doctrines From 1693 \( legendary date , historically since 1723 \) to the present day the Union of Utrecht Church survives throughout Western Europe , North America , Central America , and South America The historical lineage includes the Old Catholic Church , the Polish National Catholic Church , the Catholic Church of Brazil , and the Catholic Charismatic Church of Canada , among others The Catholic Charismatic Church of Canada was established and organized by Patriarch Andre Barbeau in 1968 It was in this same year that Archbishop Barbeau prepared documentation for Paul VI concerning this supplemental rite and his own promise of obedience and allegiance to the Bishop of Rome Barbeau was ordained a Roman Catholic priest on November 21 , 1940 and served in that capacity for 28 years in the Archdiocese of Montreal , Quebec , Canada In 1968 Barbeau left the Roman Catholic Church and was consecrated a bishop and first autonomously appointed patriarch of the new Catholic Charismatic Church of Canada by pro uniate Old Catholic Bishop Charles Brearley of the Old Holy Catholic Church of England Barbeau served in this capacity until his death on February 14 , 1994 Succeeding Barbeau is Archbishop Andre Letellier , who was installed shortly after Barbeau 's death in the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart of Jesus , in Cit de Marie , which was later destroyed by fire when a bolt of lightning struck the Cathedral during a thunder storm The Catholic Charismatic Church of Canada immediately erected faith churches and faith communities in Canada and in several northeastern states in the United States by the early 1990s the church 's jurisdiction had spread as far south as Florida and later into the southwest including Arizona , New Mexico , and west Texas The Church also has branched out in Europe \( Italy \) Practices The Catholic Charismatic Rite is more conservative than some other branches of the Old Catholic Church It accepts the Seven Ecumenical Councils as binding upon all Christians and strive towards an undivided Church as experienced in the first 1 , 000 years of Christianity , prior to the East West Schism of 1054 AD It also accepts the teachings of the Council of Trent , including Trent 's definition of the seven sacraments They reject the ordination of women to the offices of deacon , priest or bishop , because this has not been believed everywhere , always , and by all \( The Declaration of Utrecht of 19th century \) However , it does allow its clergy to marry and adopt other liberalisations Members of the CCR refer to their rite as Charismatic , believing in the spiritual gifts and in the moving of the Holy Spirit Although the CCR follows a set liturgy for both the Eucharist and the Sacraments , it is not rigid so as to prevent the movement of the Holy Spirit to enliven , enlighten , and sustain It employs both traditional hymns and contemporary praise and worship songs Its preachers base their sermons on the Bible
