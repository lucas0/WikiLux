Release Critical response The film received mixed reviews from critics , registering a 61 rating on Rotten Tomatoes Roger Ebert gave the movie three and a half out of four stars , crediting it for its unique portrayal of Gulf War Marines who battled boredom and a sense of isolation rather than enemy combatants Entertainment Weekly magazine gave the film a B rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote In his review for the Washington Post , Stephen Hunter praised Jake Gyllenhaal 's performance What 's so good about the movie is Gyllenhaal 's refusal to show off he does n't seem jealous of the camera 's attention when it goes to others and is content , for long stretches , to serve simply as a prism through which other young men can be observed Sight and Sound magazine 's Leslie Felperin wrote , If nothing else , Jarhead provides some kind of reportage of a war whose consequences we have n't yet begun to understand , a war now elbowed into history by its still raging sequel USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and wrote , What we 're left with is solid if not exceptional , though it 's good to see Mendes expanding as a filmmaker Time magazine 's Richard Schickel wrote , But the best war movies and this one , despite its being overlong and repetitive , is among them hold that men fight \( or in this case , are ready to fight \) not for causes , but to survive and to help their comrades do the same However , in his review for The New York Times , A O Scott felt that the film was full of intensity with almost no real visceral impact , and called it a minor movie about a minor war , and a film that feels , at the moment , remarkably irrelevant Kenneth Turan in his review for the Los Angeles Times wrote In his review for the Village Voice , J Hoberman wrote , A master of the monotone , Mendes prompts his performers to hit a note and sustain it Although Jarhead is more visually accomplished and less empty than American Beauty or Road to Perdition , it still feels oppressively hermetic Nathaniel Fick , another author who is a Marine , gave the film a mixed review \( and panned the book on which it is based \) in Slate He wrote , Jarhead also presents wild scenes that probably could happen in combat units , but strips them of the context that might explain how they 're more than sheer lunacy James Meek , who reported from the battlefields of Iraq , reviewed the film in the pages of The Guardian He wrote , The key to a film about war is how it ends , and if the young man at the film 's centre is lifted out of the battlefield uninjured and sane , if his family and home life before and after are n't prominent in the picture , the movie is diminished as a film which says something about war and becomes a simpler story of growing up , of jeopardy overcome Baghdad Express In a New York Times article , it was noted that war veteran and writer Joel Turnipseed felt that parts of the film 's plot had been taken from his 2002 book Baghdad Express A Gulf War Memoir , without his consent Jarhead screenwriter William Broyles , Jr claimed that many similarities arise from the retelling of common Marine experiences Accolades
