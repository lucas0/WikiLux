The Sikorsky CH 124 Sea King is a twin engined anti submarine warfare \( ASW \) helicopter designed for shipboard use The Canadian variant is based on the US Navy 's SH 3 \( or S 61 \) and has been continuously in service with the Royal Canadian Navy and Canadian Forces since 1963 Design and development The advent of nuclear powered attack submarines in the late 1950s prompted RCN leaders to assess the new threat they posed Although these craft were noisier than older submarines and could therefore be detected at longer ranges , they were also capable of while submerged , which was faster than the top speed of the RCN 's new St Laurent class destroyers at Some RCN leaders harbored serious doubts that the destroyers could effectively pursue and destroy such fast vessels , even when operating in pairs During a 25 February 1959 meeting of the Naval Board , it was decided that the Navy would counter the new threat by outfitting destroyers for helicopter operation Soward 1995 , pp 169 171 The RCN had examined the feasibility of operating ASW helicopters from small escorts when it modified the Prestonian class frigate in mid 1956 with a temporary helicopter landing platform Successful trials were held in October 1956 using a Sikorsky HO4S 3Soward 1995 , pp 63 65 Crowsnest Magazine Vol 17 , Nos 3 and 4 March April 1965 and a larger temporary landing platform was soon installed on the new destroyer escort Operational trials were conducted using an RCAF Sikorsky S 58 , a substantially larger and heavier aircraft than the HO4S , and the success of these tests led to approval of the concept Soward 1995 , pp 92 93 To achieve the goal , the RCN needed a helicopter capable of all weather day and night operations with a heavy weapons load capabilities the HO4S , the RCN 's current utility helicopter , did not possess Initial 1959 studies identified two helicopters that would meet the upcoming requirements the Sikorsky S 61 \( HSS 2 \) and the Kaman K 20 \( HU2K \) but neither aircraft had flown at the time , so no choice was made After further studies concluded that the smaller Kaman would better satisfy RCN requirements , the Treasury Board approved an initial procurement of 12 HU2K helicopters for 14 5 million in December 1960 Despite this apparent setback for Sikorsky , several factors would derail the Kaman proposal When the Naval Board held a follow up meeting on 27 January 1961 to discuss the program , it was revealed that the asking price for the initial 12 units had nearly doubled to 23 million , a mere 6 weeks after the Treasury Board had approved the purchase The Naval Board continued to endorse the HU2K , but some RCN leaders had serious misgivings due to the drastic price increase and staff reports that Kaman 's performance projections might be overly optimistic The Naval Board decided to await upcoming USN sea trials of the HU2K before rendering a final decision Soward 1995 , pp 244 246 The USN trials confirmed the calculations of RCN staff members the HU2K was substantially heavier than promised , hampering its flight performance and rendering it incapable of meeting RCN requirements , even if Kaman were to install a proposed upgraded engine The Sea King was ultimately chosen for production on 20 December 1961 Soward 1995 , pp 261 262 The first of 41 helicopters would be delivered in 1963 carrying the designation CHSS 2 Sea King The airframe components were made by Sikorsky in Connecticut but most CHSS 2s were assembled in Longueuil , Quebec \( Montreal \) by United Aircraft of Canada \( now Pratt Whitney Canada \) , a subsidiary of Sikorsky 's parent company On 27 November 1963 , the new landing platform aboard HMCS Assiniboine \( DDH 234 \) was used for the first operational destroyer landing of a production CHSS 2 Soward 1995 , pg 326 Upon the unification of Canada s military in 1968 , the CHSS 2 was re designated CH 124 The RCN developed a technique for landing the huge helicopters on small ship decks , using a 'hauldown' winch \( called a 'Beartrap' \) , earning aircrews the nickname of 'Crazy Canucks' The 'Beartrap' allows recovery of the Sea King in virtually any sea state ST LAURENT Class History In 1968 , the RCN , Royal Canadian Air Force \( RCAF \) and Canadian Army unified to form the Canadian Forces air units were dispersed throughout the new force structure until Air Command \( AIRCOM \) was created in 1975 Operational service thumb Sikorsky CH 124A Sea King The Sea King is assigned to Iroquois class \( 2 per ship with total of 6 \) destroyers , Halifax class \( 1 per ship with total of 12 \) frigates , and Protecteur class replenishment ships \( 3 per ship with total 6 \) as a means of extending the surveillance capabilities beyond the horizon When deployed , the Sea King is accompanied by a number of crews each with 2 pilots , a Tactical Coordinator \( TACCO \) , and an Airborne Electronic Sensor Operator \( AESOp \) In order to find submarines , the Sea King 's sonar uses a transducer ball at the end of a 450 foot cable It can also be fitted with FLIR \( Forward Looking Infra Red \) to find surface vessels at night The CH 124 has undergone numerous refits and upgrades , especially with regard to the electronics , main gearboxes and engines , surface search radar , secure cargo and passenger carrying capabilities Replacement From 1983 onward attempts were made to replace the aging Sea King helicopters Due to a series of financial and political issues , the process was hampered by repeated delays In the end the CH 148 Cyclone , a new version of the Sikorsky H 92 Superhawk was selected Variants CH 124 Anti submarine warfare helicopter for the Royal Canadian Navy \( 41 assembled by United Aircraft of Canada \) CH 124A The Sea King Improvement Program \( SKIP \) added modernized avionics as well as improved safety features CH 124B Alternate version of the CH 124A without a dipping sonar but formerly with a MAD sensor and additional storage for deployable stores In 2006 , the 5 aircraft of this variant were converted to support the Standing Contingency Task Force \( SCTF \) , and were modified with additional troop seats , and frequency agile radios Plans to add fast rope capability , EAPSNIPS \( Engine Air Particle Separator Snow Ice Particle Separator \) did not come to fruition CH 124B2 6 CH 124B 's were upgraded to the CH 124B2 standard in 1991 1992 The revised CH 124B2 retained the sonobuoy processing gear to passively detect submarines but , the aircraft was now also fitted with a towed array sonar to supplement the ship 's sonar Since anti submarine warfare is no longer a major priority within the Canadian Forces , the CH 124B2 were refitted again to become improvised troop carriers for the newly formed Standing Contingency Task Force CH 124C One CH 124 operated by the Helicopter Operational Test and Evaluation Facility located at CFB Shearwater Used for testing new gear , and when not testing new gear , it is deployable to any Canadian Forces ship requiring a helicopter CH 124U Unofficial designation for 4 CH 124 's that were modified for passenger freight transport One crashed in 1973 , and the survivors were later refitted to become CH 124A 's Operators Royal Canadian NavySikorsky CH 124 Sea King Canadian Forces Air Command Royal Canadian Air Force 443 Maritime Helicopter
