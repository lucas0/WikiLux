is a study on the nature and power of thoughts \( ISBN 0 8356 0008 4 \) The authors state that thoughts have two effects a radiating vibration and a floating form Thought forms are divided into three classes That which takes the image of the thinker That which takes the image of some material object That which takes a form entirely its own , expressing its inherent qualities in the matter which it draws round it The effect of music , emotions , and colors on thought forms is also studied in the book The effect of the music of Mendelssohn \( No 9 of his Songs without words \) , Gounod \( Soldiers Chorus from Faust \) and Richard Wagner \( Overture to The Meistersingers \) is studied The music of Wagner produced a marvellous mountain range on the thought forms See also Poltergeist
