of the prosperity gospel I get grouped into the prosperity gospel and I never think it 's fair , but it 's just what it is I think prosperity , and I 've said it 1 , 000 times , it 's being healthy , it 's having great children , it 's having peace of mind Money is part of it and yes , I believe God wants us to excel to be blessed so we can be a bigger blessing to others I feel very rewarded I wrote a book and sold millions of copies and Victoria and I were able to help more people than we ever dreamed of But when I hear the term prosperity gospel , I think people are sometimes saying ,

supposedly showing Lakewood free of flooding were taken on Monday , after the flood waters had lowered Osteen countered the claim that flood waters closed the church , saying the church has been open from the beginning , and , w e 've always been open How this notion got started , that we 're not a shelter and we 're not taking people in is a false narrative This contradicted his earlier statement
