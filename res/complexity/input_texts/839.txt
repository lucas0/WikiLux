Qu'Appelle , Saskatchewan , is a small locality located on Trans Canada Highway 1 and the Canadian Pacific Railway mainline , some thirty miles east of Regina , Saskatchewan With its for a time seemingly long term terminus status for the Canadian Pacific Railway its lush rolling parkland setting , intermittent coulees \( gentle valleys with steady flowing creeks \) and bluffs \( the local term for aspen groves \) and generally picturesque locale both in summer and winter and its ready access to ample water Qu'Appelle had at one stage been credibly anticipated to be a major metropole by both the federal government of Canada it was under serious consideration by the federal government for district headquarters of the District of Assiniboia and territorial headquarters of the North West Territories and the Church of England \( now the Anglican Church of Canada \) , which for a time designated Qu'Appelle the cathedral city for the Diocese of Qu'Appelle , geographically corresponding precisely to the District of Assiniboia in the North West Territories Political events , however , passed Qu'Appelle entirely by and when Lieutenant Governor Edgar Dewdney elected the locale of his own landholdings some 30 miles to the west of Qu'Appelle as his Territorial capital , Qu'Appelle 's significance other than in historical terms largely lapsed History left thumb 275px

Canadian prairie towns , Qu'Appelle has enjoyed a considerably more lively past than present Qu'Appelle , however , has in particular been a near miss throughout its unfortunate history It was as demonstrated by its now entirely historical commemoration as the historical see city of the Anglican Diocese of Qu'Appelle at one point the obvious choice as the capital of the North West sic Territories Its bypassing is a matter of considerable irony , both in terms of latter day ideas of probity in public life and the practicalities of arranging for the later ongoing administration of Regina , a city of considerable importance , some 30 miles to the west of Qu'Appelle , where none of Qu'Appelle 's felicitous amenities pertain Founding and naming left thumb 255px Northern Bank , Qu'Appelle , prior to 1925 when it was taken over by the Royal Bank of Canada the branch continued to operate until the 1960s when reduced commercial activity in Qu'Appelle and declining population in the hinterland made it no longer viable Founded as Troy in 1882 , for a time it appeared likely to be the administrative headquarters for the District of Assiniboia , corresponding to the southern portion of the later province of Saskatchewan Indeed , the considerable beauty of the topography of the region it is in an amply watered rolling parkland with lush aspen groves \( poplar bluffs in local terminology \) and densely treed coulees leading into the Qu'Appelle Valley makes it especially unfortunate that this turned out not to be so , given the relative lack of natural amenity of Regina , the site actually chosen , where there is no locally available water other than from the small spring runoff Wascana Creek , the local topography is devoid of features and the local plain is entirely devoid of trees that have not been planted by civic authorities and settlers When the Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in 1884 the new town was renamed Qu'Appelle StationMcLennon , Qu'Appelle , The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan Retrieved 13 July 2007 and in 1902 the name was changed to South Qu'Appelle There was longstanding confusion as to the name Qu'Appelle , which also referred to the former Hudson 's Bay Company fort town in the Qu'Appelle Valley , to the northeast of Qu'Appelle in 1911 the two communities agreed to rationalise the confusion in their names by deeming the then

international events when access to wider news organs was not locally available Latterly it devolved to a local community paper , largely subsisting on reports from farm wives as to the waning hinterland rural communities as substantive civic events in Qu'Appelle became less newsworthy , with community reporters phoning in accounts of events in such now entirely historic rural communities
