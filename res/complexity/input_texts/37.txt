were very much behind President Nixon , like the rest of the country They thought he could do no wrong , and when I was in Connecticut , I would get flipped the bird all the time , whether it was on the streets or in the car , for the role that I was playing After Watergate was over , then the needle goes all the way the other way , and I 've got huge favorability ratings Proving this , Weicker was convincingly reelected in 1976 In 1980 , he made an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination for President Weicker Opens Presidential Campaign , March 13 , 1979 Weicker was a liberal voice in an increasingly conservative Republican Party For instance , in 1986 , Americans for Democratic Action rated Weicker as by far the most liberal Republican in the Senate , and gave him a higher rating than Connecticut 's other Senator , Democrat Chris Dodd Kornacki , Steve \( 2011 01 19 \) The making \( and unmaking \) of Joe Lieberman , Salon He was critical of the increasing influence of the Christian right on the party he described the separation of church and state as this country 's greatest contribution to world civilization , and the party in 2012 as swung off so far to the right that no moderate could 've survived a primary Weicker was a strong advocate for the rights of the disabled during his time in Congress , although he ultimately lost his seat before the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 passed In later interviews , Weicker identified his work on the Americans with Disabilities Act , funding the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , increasing the funding for the National Institutes of Health , and funding research into AZT as his proudest achievements in the Senate Weicker 's tense relations with establishment Republicans may have roots in receiving strong support from Nixon in his 1970 Senate bid , support repaid in the eyes of his critics by a vehement attack on the White House while serving on the Watergate Committee Later , his relations with the Bush family soured , and Prescott Bush Jr \( the brother of the then Vice President \) made a short lived bid against Weicker to gain the 1982 Republican Senate nomination His liberalism increasingly alienated Connecticut Republicans , particularly after an effort to prevent the nomination of conservatives to state office , which resulted in a poor showing during the 1986 local elections , and he was defeated in the 1988 Senate election by Joe Lieberman Lieberman benefited from the support of National Review publisher William F Buckley Jr , and his brother , former New York Senator James Buckley William Buckley ran columns in support of Lieberman and circulated bumper stickers with the slogan , Does Lowell Weicker Make You Sick \? Governor Weicker 's political career appeared to be over after his 1988 defeat , and he became a professor at the George Washington University Law School However , he entered the 1990 gubernatorial election as the candidate of A Connecticut Party , running as a good government candidate and drawing on his coalition of liberal Republicans , moderate Democrats , and independent voters The early 1990s recession had hit Connecticut hard , worsened by the fall in revenues from traditional sources such as sales tax and corporation tax , and exacerbating the state 's inequality and crime rates Connecticut politics had a tradition at the time of opposition to a state income tax one had been implemented in 1971 but rescinded after six weeks under public pressure Weicker initially campaigned on a platform of solving Connecticut 's fiscal crisis without implementing an income tax He won in a three way race with Republican John G Rowland and Democrat Bruce Morrison , taking 40 of the vote against Rowland 's 37 and Morrison 's 20 Weicker lost Fairfield and New Haven County counties to Rowland , but won eastern Connecticut , drawing especially strong support from the Hartford metro area , where he had been strongly endorsed by the Hartford Courant and by many state employee labor unions The Los Angeles Times wrote that support from Democrats was credited for Weicker 's victory , reflected in Morrison 's third place finish After taking office , with a projected 2 4 billion deficit , Weicker reversed himself and pushed for the adoption of an income tax , a move that was severely unpopular He stated , My policy when I came in was no income tax , but that fell apart on the rocks of fiscal fact Weicker vetoed three budgets that did not contain an income tax , and forced a partial government shutdown , before the General Assembly narrowly passed it in 1991 The 1991 budget set the income tax rate at 6 , lowered the sales tax from 8 to 6 while expanding its base , reduced the corporate tax to 10 5 over two years , and eliminated taxes on capital gains , interest , and dividends It also included 1 2 billion in line by line budget cuts , including the elimination of state aid to private and parochial schools , but held the line on social programs His drastic measures provoked controversy A huge protest rally in Hartford attracted some 40 , 000 participants , some of whom cursed at and spat at Governor Weicker The Assembly attempted to pass a measure repealing the broad based income tax , which he vetoed , and the override of a veto fell one vote short Weicker earned lasting criticism for his implementation of the income tax the conservative Yankee Institute claimed in August 2006 that after fifteen years the income tax had failed to achieve its stated goals However , he earned national attention for his leadership on the issue , receiving the John F Kennedy Library Foundation 's Profiles in Courage award for taking an unpopular stand , then holding firm Within two years , the state 's budget was in surplus and he was well regarded among voters In retirement , he commented , You 've had 19 years to repeal it , and all you 've done is spend it Weicker did not seek re election as governor in 1994 His last year in office was marked by a controversy over the firing of the state commissioner of motor vehicles , Louis Goldberg In 2000 , he endorsed Senator Bill Bradley \( D NJ \) for President In 2004 , Weicker supported former Vermont Gov Howard Dean 's \( D VT \) presidential bid He expressed sympathy for the budget struggles of Governor Dannel Malloy , drawing a parallel with his own efforts to remedy a fiscal crisis In his book Independent Nation \( 2004 \) , political analyst John Avlon describes Weicker as a radical centrist governor and thinker Avlon , John \( 2004 \) Independent Nation How the Vital Center Is Changing American Politics Harmony Books Random House , pp 177 93 \( Radical Centrists \) 2006

will do it run against Senator Lieberman , I 'd have to give serious thought to doing it myself , and I do n't want to do it The Lieberman campaign released an ad that borrowed from one aired during
