Television of Serbia had a small role in financing the film , and the film used rented Yugoslav Army \( VJ \) equipment as props Reaction As soon as Underground premiered at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival and especially when it was awarded Palme d'Or , it faced aggressive and vitriolic criticism in Europe along political lines Critics saw the characters Marko and Blacky as Kusturica 's idealization of Serbs trapped into desperate acts by history and others' evil while the cowardly characters in the film were Croats and Bosnians , who chose betrayal and collaboration While some critics claimed the film propagated a pro Serbian view of the Yugoslav conflict \( including animosities during WWII \) , others suggested that its characterization of Balkan ethnic groups was equally caustic to each Stanko Cerovi Stanko Cerovi , director of the Serbo Croatian editorial department of Radio France Internationale , strongly denounced the movie in June 1995 , accusing Kusturica of spreading Serbian propaganda In the years since , Cerovi seemingly substantially changed his opinion of Kusturica and of Underground Asked in February 2012 about the movie and its director , Cerovi said L vy and Finkielkraut vs Kusturica Throughout the 1990s , Kusturica was frequently attacked by French public intellectuals Bernard Henri L vy and Alain Finkielkraut in the French media over his life and career choices Generally , the two adopted the Bosnian Muslim official nationalist view of Kusturica as a traitor who crossed over to the enemy side thus turning his back on his city , his ethnic roots , and his nation , https www nytimes com 1995 12 05 movies dispute leads bosnian to quit films html often publicly attacking him along similar lines Kusturica , for his part , did n't hold back either , responding aggressively to the duo 's accusations The L vy and Finkielkraut attacks particularly intensified after Underground won Palme d'Or in 1995 , often crossing over into name calling and insults It started in June 1995 with Finkielkraut accusing the Cannes jury in Le Monde of rewarding a Pan Serbian nationalist propagandist Kusturica responded several months later , parodying Finkielkraut in sarcastic tone while criticizing Le Monde for even publishing Finkielkraut 's vitriolic text without him seeing the film first Finkielkraut was thus forced into admitting that he had n't actually seen the movie when he wrote the previous piece , justifying this by writing in Lib ration that offensive and stupid falsification of the traitor taking the palm of martyrdom had to be denounced immediately Meanwhile , L vy called Kusturica a fascist author while reserving his further judgment upon seeing the film Le Point , Bloc Note of June 10 , 1995 and of October 21 , 1995 After watching Underground , L vy called Kusturica a racist genius in the mold of Louis Ferdinand C line Le Point , Bloc Note of November 4 , 1995 and later even made a film criticizing Underground The entire episode soon prompted other intellectuals such as Andr Glucksmann and Peter Handke to join the debate During the September 2008 discussion between the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj i ek and Bernard Henri L vy on the issues surrounding the historical and social significance of May 1968 in France , i ek brought up Underground and Kusturica to L vy by saying Let me find another point of contact with you I hope we share another point , which is to be brutal hatred of Emir Kusturica We do agree here Underground I think is one of the most horrible films that I 've seen because it 's as if this poem by Radovan Karad i that I quoted was set to film there What kind of Yugoslav society you see in Kusturica 's Underground \? A society where people all the time fornicate , drink , fight a kind of eternal orgy And here what you referred to as this eternal youth excessive energy one path , I'm not saying the only one , one path leads to Radovan Karad i I claim I claim that the moral duty today is precisely to problematize this carnivalist transgressive model 'Order is bad , let 's suspend the rules , let 's have a free excess and so on' L vy answered that he considers himself an enemy of Kusturica , the man , but that Underground is not a bad movie before going on to commend the film 's narrative structure and conclude that Kusturica is one of the cases , we have some writers like this , where the man is so , so , so more stupid than his work before likening Kusturica again to Louis Ferdinand C line Biljana Srbljanovi The reaction to the film continued long after its theatrical life ended On 8 March 2001 , Serbian newsmagazine Vreme published an op ed piece titled 'Hvala lepo' by Serbian playwright Biljana Srbljanovi in which she refers in passing to Underground as being financed by Milo evi and accuses Kusturica of being an immoral profiteer She goes on to accuse the director of directly collaborating with the regime via his friend Milorad Vu eli On 20 March 2001 , Kusturica decided to sue Srbljanovi for libel Before the first court date in September 2001 , Vreme magazine organized a mediation attempt between the two parties , with Kusturica and Srbljanovi meeting face to face in the magazine 's offices At the meeting Kusturica expressed willingness to drop the charges if Srbljanovi issues a public apology , which Srbljanovi refused The next day at the first court date Srbljanovi once again rejected the offer of a public apology The court case thus continued with Kusturica 's lawyer Branislav Tapu kovi presenting details of the film 's financing sources , most of which were French production companies On 11 December 2003 , the municipal court ruled in Kusturica 's favour , ordering Srbljanovi to pay the damages as well as to cover the court costs Aleksandar Hemon Bosnian American novelist Aleksandar Hemon criticized Underground in 2005 , saying that it downplayed Serbian atrocities by presenting the Balkan war as a product of collective , innate , savage madness Critical reception United States Underground has not been widely reviewed by English language critics , though it has gained generally favorable reviews Rotten Tomatoes reports 81 approval based on 31 critics In the New York Daily News , Dave Kehr lauded the film as ferociously intelligent and operatically emotional , and Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it a sprawling , rowdy , vital film laced with both outrageous absurdist dark humor and unspeakable pain , suffering and injustice Variety'' 's Deborah Young reviewed the film after seeing it at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival , praising it as a steamroller circus that leaves the viewer dazed and exhausted , but mightily impressed , and adding that if Fellini had shot a war movie , it might resemble Underground Janet Maslin of the New York Times wrote that the film 's real heart is its devastating idea of a morning after the moment when , after being in the grip of a political delusion lasting several decades , a man can emerge from a subterranean hiding place in his native Yugoslavia and be told that there is no Yugoslavia any more While acknowledging that the politics of Underground have been assailed and dissected by international audiences , she feels that this debate is largely specious as there 's no hidden agenda to this robust and not terribly subtle tale of duplicity with Mr Kusturica 's central idea being a daringly blunt representation of political chicanery that fools an entire society , and of the corruption that lets one man thrive at the expense of his dearest friend Accolades The film won the Palme d'Or \( Golden Palm \) award at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival , considered the festival 's highest honor It was director Emir Kusturica 's second such award after When Father Was Away on Business , making Kusturica one of only eight filmmakers to receive two Golden Palms 1997 , the film won Best Foreign Language Film awards from the Boston Society of Film Critics and the National Society of Film Critics , following its release in
