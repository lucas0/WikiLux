customer to mouse click on currency bets , even though there is no counterparty , as the bets are stored inside Saxo bank 's records only Saxo bank recently removed the capability to naked short sell shares in Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Citibank , etc in compliance with U S government regulations Naked short selling is still practiced by Saxo bank on all other financial instruments Naked short selling is where a client can bet that a particular instrument will loose value , even though neither the client nor Saxo bank own or have any connection to any of the instruments This practice allows Saxo bank to accept bets for almost unlimited amounts of Saxo money since there is no real money involved until the client attempts to withdraw funds from Saxo 's account Therefore Saxo bank charges the client very high interest for lending the client hundreds of millions of Saxo euros as Saxo bank 's software claims that the client has made multi miilion euro bets and then charges the client 's real money account the interest See also Team CSC Saxo Bank External Links www saxobank com References Category Banks of Denmark Category Banks established in 1992 da Saxo Bank no Saxo Bank zh
