The Siege of Zadar \( 12 August 1345 21 December 1346 \) was a successful attempt of the Republic of Venice to capture Zadar \( or Zara \) , a Croatian coastal city in northern Dalmatia It was a combined land and sea offensive by the Venetians , consisting of many separate battles and operations against the citizens of Zadar , who refused to accept Venetian suzerainty and demanded autonomy Despite receiving military aid from Croato Hungarian king Louis the Angevin , Zadar was unable to resist the siege and was finally defeated Background The siege resulted from the long term complex political relations between the City of Zadar and the Republic of Venice as well as from the change of policy of the Croato Hungarian ruler after the young Louis of Angevin ascended the throne in 1342 The king wished to maintain full control over the territory of the Kingdom of Croatia , including cities and towns of Dalmatia , most of which were in the hands of the Venetians The citizens of Zadar rebelled against the rule of the Serenissima Repubblica in 1344 , asking king Louis for help He launched military campaigns to the south of Croatia in September 1344 and in July 1345 , but they did not bring the desired breakthrough In the meantime the Venetians decided to protect their interests in Dalmatia , gathered troops \( some 20 000 25 000 \) and sent them in the summer of 1345 to the area of Zadar They had both naval and land forces at their diposal , whereas king Louis commanded only land forces Siege On 12 August 1345 Venetians started to besiege the city and the surrounding castles Their land army was commanded by Marco Giustiniani and their marine forces were under the command of Pietro de Canale The siege consisted of many separate operations , movements , battles and other military activities , that can be divided into three phases The first phase ended at the end of January 1346 with the Venetians' breaking of the harbour chain which from the beginning of siege prevented Venetian galleys from entering the Zadar port The breaking enabled the besiegers to come closer to the city walls and to control the movements of Zadar ships In the meantime , Pietro Civrano took over supreme command of the Venetian forces as capitaneus generalis The second phase was marked by the king Louis' army entering the conflict In late springtime the King 's forces attacked the Venetian fortress \( bastida \) built near Zadar at the beginning of the siege , but without success Although large in number \( according some sources up to 100 000 men \) , they were compressed in the narrow passage between the fortress and the sea , so they could not come closer strong enough to capture the fortress Besides , they were under heavy fire from two sides from the Venetian ships and from ballistic devices in the fortress The major attack of the Croato Hungarian forces took place on 1 July 1346 , but at the end the Venetians carried the day Louis the Angevin decided to retreat and ordered his troops to move northwards In the third phase Zadar 's defenders remained alone They were short of food and water and without new supply lines , but they fought on until December Finally , on 21 December 1346 the Venetian troops marched into town and took control of it Aftermath The city of Zadar remained under Venetian control until king Louis the Angevin invaded Venetian territories and captured all Dalmatian cities and islands in 1357 On 18 February 1358 the Treaty of Zadar was signed in the city , in which the Republic of Venice renounced the territory between the Gulf of Kvarner and the city of Durr s in favour of Louis Zadar remained a self governing community under Croato Hungarian kings and queens until 1409 , when it was sold , together with all of Dalmatia , to the Republic of Venice by the king Ladislaus of Naples He was about to be defeated by his opponent for the crown , Sigismund the Luxemburgian , and took the opportunity to sell his regal rights over Dalmatia for the sum of 100 000 ducats See also Timeline of Croatian history Timeline of the Republic of Venice List of sieges Treaty of Zadar Siege of Zadar \( 998 \) Siege of Zadar \( 1202 \) Siege of Zadar \( 1813 \) Military history of Croatia Military history of the Republic of Venice Kingdom of Croatia \( 1102 1526 \) External links Siege of Zadar a long siege launched by the Venetian land and naval forces Siege of Zadar showed the naval power of Venice Siege of Zadar one of the longest sieges in Croatian history \( 16 months \) \( Croatian \) Diplomatic activities of the citizens of Zadar during the siege 1345 1346 \( Croatian \) Zadar Zadar Zadar Category 1340s conflicts Category Venetian period in the history of Croatia Category 14th century in Croatia Category 1345 in Europe Category 1346 in Europe Zadar Category Kingdom of Croatia Zadar 1345 Category Conflicts in 1345 Category Conflicts in 1346 Category History of Zadar Zadar 1345 Zadar Category 14th century in the Republic of Venice
