Carswell stated in July 2012 that his expenses had been greater than those of other MPs due to his need to rent accommodation close to parliament Influence in the Conservative Party Conservative Party commentator and Daily Telegraph columnist Charles Moore credits Carswell , together with MEP Daniel Hannan , as the architects behind the idea of a Great Repeal Bill , as well as the concept of a Contract with Britain offered during the election , the recall of MPs who have displeased their constituents , open primaries for the selection of parliamentary candidates , and plans for elected police commissioners According to Moore 's analysis not only is The localism of the Carswell Hannan direct democracy movement is now good Coalition orthodoxy , but Cameron 's policy guru , Steve Hilton , enthusiastically lifted several bits of The Plan , the best selling moderniser book written by Carswell and co author Daniel Hannan Even before the formation of the Coalition , the influence of Carswell 's ideas was evident in speeches made by David Cameron most notably a speech to the Open University made by David Cameron in Milton Keynes in May 2009 Influence on UKIP and Leave New Statesman commentator Stephen Bush has argued that Carswell was correct to recognise that a successful Brexit campaign depended on its messages being associated with people other than Farage , but also observed that there is no electoral majority to be found Britain for the libertarian brand of conservatism that Carswell espouses Bush also suggested that Carswell 's ability to win his seat owed more to the appeal of his party to Clacton 's voters than his own personal influence , observing that the evidence suggests that he has kept his seat thanks to the popularity of the party leaders he has consistently undermined and worked against During his time as a UKIP MP , Carswell , along with Mark Reckless and Stephen Crowther , established UKIP Parliamentary Resource Unit Limited After
