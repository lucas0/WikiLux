his sister from destitution He had been a hardened bank robber who had taken a hostage on at least one occasion and had committed a murder in 1933 Young was also no stranger to the penal system Before being incarcerated at Alcatraz in 1936 , he had already served time in two state prisons in Montana and Washington In 1935 he spent his first year in federal correctional facilities at McNeil Island , Washington before being transferred to Alcatraz The film ends with the fictional Henri Young being returned to the dungeons of Alcatraz in the early 1940s where he supposedly dies In reality the real Young remained on Alcatraz until 1948 before he was moved to the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield , Missouri where he stayed until 1954 While on Alcatraz he remained in the main cell block Young was not kept in any dungeon as they had been closed almost a decade earlier In 1954 Young was transferred to the Washington State Penitentiary at Walla Walla to begin a life sentence for the murder conviction in 1933 In 1972 after Young was released from Washington State Penitentiary at age 61 , he jumped parole According to Washington State authorities his whereabouts remain unknown Young was born in 1911 if still alive as of , he would be about years old According to The San Francisco Examiner , April 16 , 1941 , the Defense stated in court that Henri Young was locked up in solitary confinement for over 3 years This is taken directly from the paper , Emphasis which they repeatedly laid on the fact that Young was in isolation or solitary confinement for more than three years and that he drove his knife into McCain s abdomen just eleven days after release from such confinement , made it clear that the defense hopes to show not only that Young was punch drunk but that the punches were administered by the Alcatraz system Many of the ideas in the movie were taken directly from newspaper articles of the trials , including the ending scene where the jury only convicts Young of manslaughter , and requests that Alcatraz be investigated Read the document here http www notfrisco2 com alcatraz bios hyoung hyoung4 html Cast Christian Slater as
