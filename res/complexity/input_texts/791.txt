about the institutional racism in Cuba The Economist noted , The danger starts with his example after all , a young , black , progressive politician has no chance of reaching the highest office in Cuba , although a majority of the island s people are black Jorge Luis Garc a P rez , who was imprisoned for 17 years , states that the authorities in my country have never tolerated that a black

, the Cuban government moved beyond the issue of racism His message marked a shift in Cuban society s perception of racism that was triggered by the change in government focus Many who argue that Cuba is not racist base their claims on the idea of Latin American Exceptionalism According to this argument , a social history of intermarriage and mixing of the races is unique to Latin America The large mestizo populations that result from high levels of interracial union common to the region are often linked to racial democracy For many Cubans this translates into an argument of racial harmony , often referred to as racial democracy According to Mark Q Sawyer , in the case of Cuba , ideas of Latin American Exceptionalism have delayed the progress of true racial harmony Mark Sawyer Racial
