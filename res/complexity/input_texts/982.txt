' If I was going to cry anything it would have been 'Oh bloody hell ! ' I was going to have to turn it round and see the world afresh The labour would involve reconsidering everything I 'd written since 11 September , arguing with people I took to be friends and finding myself on the same side as people I took to be enemies All because of Berman Berman 's approach has not been without its critics A writer in The Nation magazine , Anatol Lieven , labeled Berman a Philosopher king of the liberal hawks and criticized him for promoting and justifying the most dangerous aspect of the Bush Administration 's approach to the war on terrorism the lumping together of radically different elements in the Muslim world into one homogeneous enemy camp Liberal Hawk Down , Anatol Lieven , The Nation , 7 October 2004 Berman has also been criticized in books by the liberal sociologist , Alan Wolfe , and the neo Marxist political theorist , Robert Meister Liberal interventionism and the Middle East Berman argued that the NATO war in the former Yugoslavia in 1999 was justified by the doctrine of liberal interventionism an intervention intended to rescue endangered populations from extreme oppression and to promote liberal and democratic freedom He looked on the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq in the same light In the run up to the invasion of Iraq , he declined to endorse the Bush administration 's policy and warned that it was likely to fail we are wielding power without liberalism , which will turn out to be no power at all Once the invasion had begun , he nonetheless called on the liberal left to support the war on humanitarian and anti totalitarian grounds , even while continuing to elaborate his criticism of the larger Bush Doctrine His pro war and anti Bush positions confused some , as they managed to irk people on each side of the American political spectrum His argument corresponded , however , to the views of the political tendency that is sometimes described as the anti totalitarian left He was one of the American signatories of the Euston Manifesto in 2006 , a British document which expressed that tendency Berman is also sometimes associated with the New Philosophers movement in France Reflecting on the Iraq war in 2007 , Berman wrote in The New York Review of Books , I approved on principle the overthrow of Saddam I never did approve of Bush 's way of going about it In the run up to the war , I became , on practical grounds , ever more fearful that , in his blindness to liberal principles , Bush was leading us over a cliff It is true and it is a matter of satisfaction to me that , in the years since then , I have not made a career of saying 'I told you so ' Speaking of Israel in an interview , Berman commented of anti Zionism that its true origin is anti Semitism , the assumption that the Jews are the center of the world and therefore the center of the world 's evil History of the 1968 generation Berman 's A Tale of Two Utopias and Power and the Idealists are the first two parts of a history of the so called Generation of 1968 \( of which he was a member \) He argues that packaged together with the liberal ideals in this movement were decidedly disturbing elements Joschka Fischer , for example , the 1968 activist who would later become a leading figure in the German Green Party and Foreign Minister , decided that there was in fact the presence of anti Semitic impulses in this movement when he saw the Revolutionary Cells participate in the Entebbe hijacking The hijackers split the passengers by ethnicity , with Jews on the one side and non Jews on the other , with the intention to kill all of the former Also , Berman tracks major figures like Bernard Kouchner the later founder of Doctors Without Borders a member of the 1968 Generation who would later marry active improvement of human rights to established political goals At the close of the book , Berman considers the effect of the war in Iraq on these graduates of '68 He suggests that the war split the movement greatly , with many now deeply aware of the dramatic excesses of the regime of Saddam Hussein , as well as the potential negative consequences if such a dictator remained in power Nonetheless , they were deeply concerned by the arguments offered by the Bush Administration Controversy In 1986 , Michael Moore became the editor of Mother Jones magazine and was fired a few months later partly for refusing to print an article by Berman that was critical of the Sandinista human rights record in Nicaragua Moore stated that he would not run the article because he believed it to be inaccurate The article was flatly wrong and the worst kind of patronizing bullshit You would scarcely know from it that the United States had been at war with Nicaragua for the last five years Cockburn , Alexander Beat The Devil Michael meets Mr Jones , Nation , September 13 , 1986 When asked about the incident , Berman described Moore as a very ideological guy and not a very well educated guy Paul Mulshine A Stupid White Man and a Smart One Newark Star Ledger , March 3 , 2003 Moore sued for wrongful dismissal and the case was settled out of court for 58 , 000 , providing Moore with seed money for his first film , Roger Me Matt Labash Michael Moore , One Trick Phony The Weekly Standard June 8 , 1998 Moore returned to the attack in 2011 in his book Here Comes Trouble , by humorously describing Berman as a neo nudnik Berman predicted that if fair elections were held in Nicaragua in 1990 , the Sandinistas would be voted out of office Berman 's other principal articles on Nicaragua appeared in The New Republic , The New Yorker , and Dissent \( The opponent of the Sandinistas , Violeta Chamorro , won the elections in that year \) His journalism on Latin American arts
