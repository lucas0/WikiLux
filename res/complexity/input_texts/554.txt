targeted on August 10 , 2016 , by means of a clickable link in an SMS text message Analysis by Citizen Lab and Lookout discovered that the link downloaded software to exploit three previously unknown and unpatched zero day vulnerabilities in iOS According to their analysis , the software can jailbreak an iPhone when a malicious URL is opened , a form of attack known as spear phishing The software installs itself and collects all communications and locations of targeted iPhones , including communications sent through iMessage , Gmail , Viber , Facebook , WhatsApp , Telegram and Skype The software can also collect Wi Fi passwords The researchers noticed that the software 's code referenced an NSO Group product called Pegasus in leaked marketing materials Pegasus had previously come to light in a leak of records from Hacking Team , which indicated the software had been supplied to the government of Panama in 2015 The researchers discovered that Mexican journalist Rafael Cabrera had also been targeted , and that the software could have been used in Israel , Turkey , Thailand , Qatar , Kenya , Uzbekistan , Mozambique , Morocco , Yemen , Hungary , Saudi Arabia , Nigeria , and
