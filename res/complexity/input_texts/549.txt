dedicated to the Truth Seekers of All Time , with a research library , lecture hall and publishing house Many of his lectures can be found online and his books are still in print Early life Manly P Hall was born in 1901 in Peterborough , Ontario , Canada , to Louise Palmer Hall , a chiropractor and member of the Rosicrucian Fellowship , and William S Hall , a dentist In 1919 Hall , who never knew his father , moved from Canada to Los Angeles , California , with his maternal grandmother to reunite with his birth mother , who was living in Santa Monica , and was almost immediately drawn to the arcane world of mysticism , esoteric philosophies , and their underlying principles Hall delved deeply into teachings of lost and hidden traditions , the golden verses of Hindu gods , Greek philosophers and Christian mystics , and the spiritual treasures waiting to be found within one 's own soul Less than a year later , Hall booked his first lecture , and the topic was reincarnation He soon took over as preacher of the Church of the People in 1919 , at Trinity Auditorium in downtown Los Angeles Hall was ordained a minister in the Church of the People on May 17 , 1923 , and a few days later , he was elected permanent pastor of the church His first publications consisted of two small pamphlets , The Breastplate of the High Priest \( 1920 \) , and Wands and Serpents Between 1921 and 1923 he wrote three books , The Initiates of the Flame published in October 1922 , The Ways of the Lonely Ones published in 1922 , and The Lost Keys of Freemasonry published in March 1923 Hall did not become a Freemason until 1954 , more than thirty years after this book was published http freemasonry bcy ca biography esoterica hall m p hall m p html During the early 1920s , Carolyn Lloyd and her daughter Estelle members of a family that controlled a valuable oil field in Ventura County , California began sending a sizeable portion of their oil income to Hall , who used the money to travel and acquire a substantial personal library of ancient literature Hall 's first trip around the world to study the lives , customs and religions of countries in Asia and Europe , which commenced December 5 , 1923 , was paid for by donations from Carolyn Lloyd and her congregation Later in 1928 , at the age of 27 years , he published An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic , Hermetic , Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy Being an Interpretation of the Secret Teachings concealed within the Rituals , Allegories and Mysteries of all Ages , which is more commonly referred to as The Secret Teachings of All Ages The major books which followed include The Dionysian Artificers \( 1936 \) , Freemasonry of the Ancient Egyptians \( 1937 \) , and Masonic Orders of Fraternity \( 1950 \) The Secret Teachings of All Ages Hall became sufficiently known and respected as a lecturer and interpreter of the writings of the ancients , and the most useful and practical elements of classical idealism , that he successfully appealed , through advertisements and word of mouth , for funds to finance the book that became The Secret Teachings of All Ages An Encyclopedia Outline of Masonic , Hermetic , Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolic Philosophy , whose original cost of publication in 1928 was estimated to be 150 , 000 , although the price of individual copies varied According to original subscription agreements on file at the Philosophical Research Society , editions were sold by subscription for 75 on a pre publication basis , but the price of this edition after delivery by the printer is understood to be One Hundred Dollars Under the subscription terms , 15 was due at signing of the agreement , and the balance of Sixty Dollars in four equal monthly payments each Several original subscription documents were located by Edie Shapiro , PRS Librarian , on August 6 , 2012 Ms Shapiro stated It appears the price was 50 , 75 or 100 \( or complimentary , depending \) , so an exact accounting of the costs may not be possible to reconstruct The H S Crocker Company of San Francisco agreed to publish the book if Hall could secure the interest of book designer John Henry Nash , who once worked as a printer to the Vatican After The Secret Teachings of All Ages was published , Hall went from being just another earnest young preacher in the City of Angels to becoming an icon of the increasingly influential metaphysical movement sweeping the country in the 1920s His book challenged assumptions about society 's spiritual roots and made people look at them in new ways Hall dedicated The Secret Teachings of All Ages to the proposition that concealed within the emblematic figures , allegories and rituals of the ancients is a secret doctrine concerning the inner mysteries of life , which doctrine has been preserved in toto among a small band of initiated minds As one writer put it The result was a gorgeous , dreamlike book of mysterious symbols , concise essays and colorful renderings of mythical beasts rising out of the sea , and angelic beings with lions' heads presiding over somber initiation rites in torch lit temples of ancestral civilizations that had mastered latent powers beyond the reach of modern man In 1988 , Hall himself wrote The greatest knowledge of all time should be available to the twentieth century not only in the one shilling editions of the Bohn Library in small type and shabby binding , but in a book that would be a monument , not merely a coffin John Henry Nash agreed with me Personal life Hall and his followers went to extreme lengths to keep any gossip or information that could tarnish his image from being publicized , and little is known about his first marriage , on April 28 , 1930 , to Fay B deRavenne , then 28 , who had been his secretary during the preceding five years The marriage was not a happy one his friends never discussed it , and Hall removed virtually all information about her from his papers following her suicide on February 22 , 1941 Following a long friendship , on December 5 , 1950 , Hall married Marie Schweikert Bauer \( following her divorce from George Bauer \) , and the marriage though stormy was happier than his first Marie Schweikert Bauer Hall died April 21 , 2005 She was born on June 24 , 1904 Career as philosopher During the early 1930s , using money from the Lloyds , Hall traveled to France and England , where he acquired his most extensive collection of rare books and manuscripts in alchemy and esoteric fields from London auctioneer , Sotheby Company Through an agent , due to the depressed economic conditions of the era , Hall was able to buy a substantial number of rare books and manuscripts at reasonable prices When Caroline Lloyd died in 1946 , she bequeathed Hall a home , 15 , 000 in cash , and a roughly 10 , 000 portion of her estate 's annual income from shares in the world 's largest oil companies for 38 years In 1934 , Hall founded the Philosophical
