Industry Planning Council and South Australia is well suited to wind farms due to its proximity to the Roaring forties As of January 2008 , South Australia had six completed wind farms , three wind farms under construction , and one wind farm committed to construction , which took the total wind power capacity in South Australia to 801 MW More wind power is generated in South Australia than any other Australian state or territory Wind farms do not emit greenhouse gases in the generation of electricity , and so wind power is considered a highly desirable form of renewable energy which assists in the reduction of the State s reliance on coal and gas fired electricity generation Mount Millar Wind Farm \( 2006 \) Welcome to Mount Millar Wind Farm Technical considerations Wind energy conversion systems \( wind turbines \) are designed to convert the energy of wind movement \( kinetic energy \) into mechanical energy \( the movement of a machine \) This mechanical energy is then converted into electricity Australian Institute of Energy \( 2004 \) Fact Sheet 7 Wind Energy There are three principles governing the amount of energy available from the wind \( 1 \) the power generated by the turbine is proportional to the wind speed cubed \( 2 \) the power available is directly proportional to the swept area of the blades and \( 3 \) Betz' law determines the maximum theoretical efficiency of wind generators is 59 The load factor \( or capacity factor \) for South Australian wind farms is usually in the range 32 38 This means that a wind farm could typically produce between 32 and 38 of its nameplate capacity averaged over a year Wind farm overview In 2003 the only large wind turbine in South Australia was a 0 15 MW unit at Coober Pedy and by early 2004 there was 34 MW of installed wind power capacity Wind power and wind farms in South Australia As of January 2008 , South Australia had six completed wind farms \( with a total generating capacity 387 7 MW \) , three wind farms which were under construction \( with a capacity of 341 7 MW \) , and one 71 4 MW wind farm which was committed to construction , which took the total wind power capacity in South Australia to 801 MW When the current and committed wind generation is fully operational , the 801 MW should yield around 2 , 385 GWhrs a or 16 5 of forecast native energy demand in the State

Wind Farm is near Edithburgh on the coast of South Australia When it was officially opened in June 2005 it was Australia 's largest wind farm at 91 MW The installation consists of 55 wind turbines and was built at a cost of 165 million Australian dollars In April 2007 , Alinta sold Wattle Point Wind Farm to a wholly owned subsidiary of the ANZ , Energy Infrastructure Trust , for 225 million Australian dollars The District Council of Yorke Peninsula approved a second wind farm near Wattle Point , but the development has not proceeded due to insufficient capacity in the main power transmission line Lake Bonney Wind Farm \( 80 5 MW \) Lake Bonney Wind Farm Stage 1 consists of 46 turbines each having a rated capacity of 1 75 MW \( total 80 5 MW \) and was finished in March 2005 Wind power and wind farms in South Australia Wind in the Bush Mount Millar Wind Farm \( 70 MW \) Mount Millar Wind Farm \( previously called Yabmana \) is situated on an escarpment between the towns of Cowell and Cleve located 100 kilometres southwest of Whyalla The 35 wind turbines are positioned on the elongated Mount Millar site \( about 7 kilometres in length \) to maximise wind exposure The wind farm can generate up to 70 megawatts of electricity and will provide enough energy to meet the needs of about 36 , 000 typical households The Mount Millar Wind Farm is different to other SA wind farms in that the turbines do not have gear boxes and this is why the nacelle of these turbines has a larger diameter than most The wind farm connects to ElectraNet s existing transmission network at Yadnarie Substation , via a new 33km 132kV overhead transmission line and substation Construction of this wind farm started in late 2004 and was completed in December 2005 Power production started in February 2006 The 130 million project was developed by Tarong Energy Corporation Ltd Cathedral Rocks Wind Farm \( 66 MW \) Cathedral Rocks Wind Farm is in a remote coastal area located near the southern tip of the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia , about 30km south west of Port Lincoln The site covers an area of about 29km , with a coastal exposure of nearly 11km and is private farming land Hydro Tasmania \( c2005 \) Cathedral Rocks Wind Farm Cathedral Rocks Wind Farm has 33 wind turbines , with a combined generating capacity of 66 MW of electricity The wind farm was commissioned in September 2005 Before the wind farm was built , extensive environmental and cultural studies were conducted Surveys undertaken included the assessment of potential impacts to Aboriginal and European cultural heritage , flora , visual amenity , noise levels , birds and other animals Construction of the wind farm was undertaken with consideration for the environment Canunda Wind Farm \( 46 MW \) Canunda Wind Farm is a 92 5 million , 46 MW wind power project located on grazing land approximately 16 kilometres south of Millicent Wind Prospect \( undated \) Wind Clean , Safe , Australia 's Future The wind farm is made up of 23 Vestas 2 0 MW wind turbines , together with an underground electrical cable network , access tracks , crane hardstandings , wind monitoring masts and a 33kV double circuit distribution line Each turbine consists of a 67 metre high tower and 40 metre long blades , and so are 107 metres in height to the tip of the blade These wind turbines rotate at speeds between 9 rpm and 19 rpm , depending on the wind speed The Canunda Wind Farm was opened by the Premier of South Australia , Mike Rann , on the 31st of March 2005 The Canunda Wind Farm provides a number of benefits to the local and wider community , including clean electricity generation , enhanced agricultural viability of the farms involved and increased diversity of electricity supply for South Australia and the south east in particular There has also been widespread community interest in the project and site tours have commenced Starfish Hill Wind Farm \( 34 5 MW \) Starfish Hill Wind Farm is near Cape Jervis on the Fleurieu Peninsula It comprises 23 turbines of 1 5 MW each , with 8 turbines on Starfish Hill and 15 on the nearby Salt Creek Hill , with a combined generating capacity of 34 5 MW of electricity Starfish Hill Wind Farm was commissioned in September 2003 Starfish Hill \( 2004 \) Starfish Hill Wind Farm Starfish Hill Wind Farm provides enough energy to meet the needs of about 18 , 000 households , representing 2 of South Australia s residential customers , and adds about 1 to the available generation capacity in South Australia The Project was developed by Starfish Hill Wind Farm Pty Ltd , recently sold by Tarong Energy See also List of wind farms in South Australia List of active power stations in South Australia List of Australian renewable energy
