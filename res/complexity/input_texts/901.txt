Wilayat al Faqih Al Hukumah Al Islamiyyah p 72 The general idea behind this metaphor is that Khomeini objected to the laziness of many ignorant people of his day who simply kept al Kafi on their shelf , and ignored or violated it in their daily lives , assuming that they would somehow be saved from Hell just by possessing the book Khomeini argued that Islamic law should be an integral part of everyday life for the believer , not just a stale manuscript to be placed on a shelf and forgotten The irony of the allusion is telling Khomeini implicitly says that al Kafi \( the sufficient \) is not kafi \( enough \) to make you a faithful Muslim or be counted among the righteous , unless you use the wisdom contained within it and act on The famous Sh ah scholar Shaykh Sad q did n't believe in the complete authenticity of al K f Khoei points this out in his Mu jam Rij l al Had th , or Collection of Men of Narrations , in which he states Shaykh as Sad q did not regard all of the traditions in al K f to be Sahih \( truthful \) \( Arabic reference \) The scholars have made these remarks , to remind the people that one cannot simply pick the book up , and take whatever they like from it as truthful Rather , an exhaustive process of authentication must be applied , which leaves the understanding of the book in the hands of the learned From the Shia point of view , any book other than the Qur'an , as well as individual hadiths or hadith narrators can be objectively questioned and scrutinized as to their reliability , and none not even the Sahaba are exempt from this The main criticism of al Kafi as the basis for Shia fiqh , comes from prominent Sunni writers who argue that finding some hadiths in al Kafi proves that the entire Shi'ite school is wrong Shi'ites in reality do not rest the basis of their entire faith on the complete authenticity of this book \( 'Al Kafi' means the sufficient \) They believe that anything that goes against previously held ideas must not be authentic They also do not automatically accept some hadiths from al Kafi that have strong historical proofs The Qur'an is far more important to Islamic belief than any hadith book , and Shia scholars have long pointed this out Shia view of al Kafi relative to other hadith books Kulayni himself stated in his preface that he only collected hadiths he thought were important and sufficient for Muslims to know \( at a time when many Muslims were illiterate and ignorant of the true beliefs of Islam , and heretical Sufi and gnostic sects were gaining popularity \) , and he left the verification of these hadiths up to later scholars Kulayni also states , in reference to hadiths whatever \( hadith \) agrees with the Book of God \( the Qur'an \) , accept it And whatever contradicts it , reject it http www answering ansar org answers umme kulthum en chap7 php The author of al Kafi never intended for it to be politicized as infallible , he only compiled it to give sincere advice based on authentic Islamic law \( regardless of the soundess of any one particular hadith \) , and to preserve rare hadiths and religious knowledge in an easily accessible collection for future generations to study Al K f is the most comprehensive collection of traditions from the formative period of Islamic scholarship It has been held in the highest esteem by generation after generation of Muslim scholars Shaykh al Muf d \( d 1022 CE \) extolled it as one of the greatest and most beneficial of Sh ah books Al Shahid al Awwal \( d 1385 CE \) and al Mu aqqiq al Karak \( d 1533 CE \) have said , No book has served the Sh ah as it has The father of All mah al Majlis said , Nothing like it has been written for Isl m See also List of Shi'a books Sharh Usul al Kafi , a commentary on the Usul al KafiBranches of Religion \( Furu al din'' \) References External links 'Usul al Kafi English Translation , E Book Volumes 1 8' , compiled by Mu ammad Ya`q b Kulayn , translated by Mu ammad Sarwar , published by the Islamic Seminary INC NY 'Al Kafi with translation and commentary by Islamic Texts Institute' Selections from Usul al Kafi 'Ki bu l K f ' , compiled by Mu ammad Ya`q b Kulayn , published by the Islamic Seminary INC NY , translated by Mu ammad Sarwar Category Shia hadith collections Category Ja'fari jurisprudence Category Shia imams
