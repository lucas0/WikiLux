in the LDS Church Kelly has publicly argued that the system of patriarchy in the LDS Church is no longer sustainable both in terms of retaining members and in terms of our tolerance for an unequal system She argues that women and youth will flee the LDS Church as a result of gender equity issues in such numbers that the organization 's continued viability will be put into question She has argued that the ordination of women to the priesthood within the LDS Church and the transition to a structure devoid of patriarchy are vital steps for the survival of the organization Disciplinary
