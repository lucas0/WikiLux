He has criticized the Rock Radio format in regard to its artists relations , I believe the rock end of the business needs to get its act together much in the way that country did when it comes to making artists a more integral part of each radio station Management and labels need to step up and make their artists available to the stations On radio 's end , you must do a great job every time an artist is taking time out of their probably already overworked schedule We on the radio have got to make the artists feel like they have to be on the air with us or they 're missing out on something Both sides need to respect each other , help each other and feed off each other Outside Endeavors In 1992 , Brutus began a series of comic books entitled The Adventures of Brutusman The comics
