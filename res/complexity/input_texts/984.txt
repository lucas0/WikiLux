right thumb Zimbabwe Dollars ranging from 10 100 billion printed within a one year period The magnitude of the currency scalars signifies the extent of the hyperinflation Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe began shortly after destruction of productive capacity in Zimbabwe 's civil war and confiscation of white owned farmland Food output capacity fell 45 , manufacturing output 29 in 2005 , 26 in 2006 and 28 in 2007 , and unemployment rose to 80 http www netrootsmass net wordpress wp content uploads images 20100428 4 Marshall Auerback pdf During the height of inflation from 2008 09 , it was difficult to accurately account and monitor for Zimbabwe 's hyperinflation because the government of Zimbabwe stopped filing official inflation statistics This cessation in filing made it difficult to accurately observe how severe inflation was in the country In December 2008 , inflation was estimated at 6 5 quindecillion novemdecillion percent \( that 's 6 5 x 10108 which is 65 followed by 107 zeros \) The Printing Press by Steve Hanke Forbes Magazine , December 22 , 2008 In 2009 Zimbabwe abandoned its currency at present in 2012 a new currency has yet to be introduced , so currencies from other countries are used Historical context On April 18 , 1980 , the Republic of Zimbabwe was born from the former British colony of Rhodesia The Rhodesian Dollar was replaced by the Zimbabwe dollar at par value At the time when Zimbabwe gained its independence , the Zimbabwean dollar was more valuable than the US dollar In its early years , Zimbabwe experienced strong growth and development Wheat production for non drought years was proportionally higher than in the past The tobacco industry was thriving as well Economic indicators for the country were strong In the 1990s , the Zimbabwean government of president Robert Mugabe instituted land reforms intended to redistribute land from white landowners to black farmers to correct the injustices of colonialism However , many of these farmers had no experience or training in running large scale farms From 1999 2009 , the country experienced a sharp drop in food production and in all other sectors Unemployment rose and life expectancy dropped The Zanu PF government blames most of Zimbabwe 's economic woes on economic sanctions imposed by the United States of America and the European Union Illegal Sanctions to Blame for Economic Challenges Mutasa The Herald \( Harare \) However , these sanctions are not generalized , but instead involve asset freezes and visa denials targeted at 200 specific Zimbabweans closely tied to the Mugabe regime EU renews Zimbabwe sanctions , By Sebastien Berger , The Telegraph , 16 Feb 2010 Causes Economist Milton Friedman says that Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon Friedman , Milton Inflation Causes and Consequences New York Asia Publishing House That is , a general increase in the prices of things is less likely a commentary on the worth of those things than on the worth of the money This has objective and subjective components Objectively , that the money has no firm basis to give it a value Subjectively , that the people holding the money lack confidence in its ability to retain its value Crucial to both components is that the government exercise fiscal discipline over the creation of additional money However , the Mugabe government was printing money to finance involvement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and , in 2000 , in the Second Congo War , including higher salaries for army and government officials Zimbabwe was under reporting its war spending to the International Monetary Fund by perhaps 22 million a month Another motive for excessive money creation has been self dealing Transparency International ranks Zimbabwe 's government 134th of 176 in terms of institutionalized corruption The resulting lack of confidence in government undermines confidence in the future and faith in the currency Economic mis steps by government can create shortages and occupy people with workarounds rather than productivity Though this harms the economy , it does not necessarily undermine the value of the currency , but may harm confidence in the future Land reform lowered agricultural output , especially in tobacco , which accounted for one third of Zimbabwe 's foreign exchange earnings Manufacturing and mining also declined An objective reason was , again , that farms were put in the hands of inexperienced people and subjectively , that the move undermined the security of property Government instability and civic unrest were evident in other areas Zimbabwean troops , trained by North Korean soldiers , conducted a massacre in the 1980s in the southern provinces of Matabeleland and Midlands , though Mugabe 's government cites guerrilla attacks on civilian and state targets Conflicts between the Ndebele ethnic minority and Mugabe 's majority Shona people have led to many clashes , and there is also unrest between blacks and whites , in which the land reform was a factor An aspect of this reform that seeks to bar whites from business ownership induced many to leave the country Self perpetuating causes Widespread poverty and violence undermines confidence in the future The government frequently uses violence to stifle political opposition The Economist has called this a vicious cycle in addition to the poverty trap , there is also a violence trap Lack of confidence in government to practice fiscal restraint also feeds on itself In Zimbabwe , neither the issuance of banknotes of higher denominations nor proclamation of new currency regimes led holders of the currency to expect that the new money would be more stable than the old Remedies announced by the government never included a believable basis for monetary stability Thus , one reason the currency continued to lose value , resulting in hyperinflation , is that so many people expected it to Inflation rate Over the course of the five year span of hyperinflation , the inflation rate fluctuated greatly At one point , the US Ambassador to Zimbabwe predicted that it would reach 1 5 million percent In June 2008 the annual rate of price growth was 11 2 million percent The worst of the inflation occurred in 2008 and 2009 , leading to the abandonment of the currency The price of 1USD cost Z2 , 621 , 984 , 228 in October 2008 Zimbabwe inflation hits new high BBC News , October 9 , 2008 Adaptations Use of foreign currencies In 2007 , the government declared inflation illegal Anyone who raised the prices for goods and services was subject to arrest This amounted to a price freeze , which is usually ineffective in halting inflation Officials arrested numerous corporate executives for changing their prices In December 2008 , the Central Bank of Zimbabwe licensed around 1 , 000 shops to deal in foreign currency Zimbabwe economy virtually foreign exchange based media Yahoo News , January 1st 2009Zimbabwe Econet Subscribers Caught Unawares allAfrica com , January 3rd 2009 Citizens increasingly had been using foreign currency in daily exchanges , as local shops stated fewer prices in Zimbabwe dollars because they needed foreign currency to import foreign goods Many businesses and street vendors continued to do so without getting the license Harare diary 'Hope has died' , BBC News , January 21 , 2009 In January 2009 , acting Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa lifted the restriction to use only Zimbabwean dollars This too acknowledged what many were already doing Citizens were allowed to use the United States dollar , the euro , and the South African rand However , teachers and civil servants were still being paid in Zimbabwean dollars Even though their salaries were in the trillions per month , this amounted to around 1USD , or half the bus fare The government also used a restriction on bank withdrawals to try to limit the amount of money that was in circulation It limited cash withdrawals to Z500 , 000 , which was around 0 25USD Hyperinflation forces Zimbabwe to print 200 million notes \( December 6 , 2008 \) CNN Retrieved December 6 , 2008 The black market thumb right Official , black market , and OMIR exchange rates Jan 1 , 2001 to Feb 2 , 2009 Note the logarithmic scale Living with hyperinflation was a challenge for Zimbabweans Prices in shops and restaurants were still quoted in Zimbabwean dollars , but were adjusted several times a day Any Zimbabwean dollars acquired needed to be exchanged for foreign currency on the parallel market immediately , or the holder would suffer a significant loss of value For example , a mini bus driver charged riders in Zimbabwean dollars , but different rates throughout the day The evening commute was highest priced He sometimes exchanged money three times a day , not in banks but in back office rooms and parking lots Such business venues constituted a black market , an arena explicitly outside the law Transactors could evade the price freezes and the mandate to use Zimbabwean dollars But black market transactions are not enforceable under law moreover , transactors are free to flout any other Zimbabwean law The black market served the demand for daily goods such as soap and bread , as grocery stores operating within the law no longer sold items whose prices were strictly controlled , or charged customers more if they were paying in Zimbabwean dollars At one point , a loaf of bread was Z550 million in the regular market , when bread was even available apart from a trip to another country , the black market was the only option for almost all goods , and bread might cost Z10 billion Redenomination At independence in 1980 , the Zimbabwe dollar became the common currency Originally , the paper notes were Z 20 , 10 , 5 , and 2 , and the coins were Z 1 , and 50 , 20 , 10 , 5 , and 1 cents As larger bills were needed to pay for menial amounts , the Central Bank of Zimbabwe planned to print and circulate denominations of up to Z 10 , 20 , 50 , and 100 trillion Announcements of new denominations were increasingly frequent the Z 200 , 000 , 000 bill was announced just days after the printing of the Z 100 , 000 , 000 bill The government did not attempt to fight inflation with fiscal and monetary policy In 2006 , before hyperinflation reached its peak , the bank announced it would print larger bills to buy foreign currencies The Reserve Bank printed a Z 21 trillion bill to pay off debts owed to the International Monetary Fund On three occasions , the Central Bank of Zimbabwe redenominated the currency First , in August 2006 , the Central Bank recalled notes in exchange for new notes with three zeros slashed from the currency In July 2008 , the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe , Gideon Gono , announced a new Zimbabwean dollar , this time with 10 zeros removed The Z 10 billion would be redemoninated to be Z 1 This move was not just to slow inflation but also to make computations more manageable A third redenomination , producing the fourth Zimbabwe dollar , occurred in February 2009 , and dropped 12 more zeros from the currency It was thus worth 10 trillion trillion original dollars , as the three redenominations together reduced the value of an original dollar by 103 1010 1012 1025 Solutions Hyperinflation has been halted within months when government takes the necessary steps In the meantime , people patronize the black market and informal market for currencies in which they have more confidence The most direct solution is a credible promise to stop printing unlimited amounts of money However , Zimbabwean inflation has lasted for five years and the credibility of any promise is problematic Alternatively , the government could declare some foreign currency to be the nation 's official currency To facilitate commerce , it is less important which currency is adopted than that the government standardize on a single currency The US dollar , the euro , and the South African rand are candidates the US dollar has the most credibility and is the most widely traded within Zimbabwe or Zimbabwe could join the nearby nations of Lesotho , Namibia , South Africa , and Swaziland , which constitute the Common Monetary Area , or Rand Zone by formally deciding to use the rand to promote trade and stability Short of abandoning the Zimbabwean dollar , Zimbabwe could enact a strict monetary policy For example , the government would allow the exchange rate to float for a period of perhaps 30 days , so that the market would decide its true value , then declare a fixed exchange rate with the rand and declare the rand a currency simultaneous with the Zimbabwean dollar The supply of Zimbabwean dollars would be limited , perhaps by a currency board such as in Hong Kong , which has no other constraint than to maintain the fixed exchange rate Currently Zimbabwe uses a combination of foreign currencies , but mostly US dollars A solution has not been decided on as of 2011 , and the economy is still in a slump References Further reading Steve H Hanke , Zimbabwe From Hyperinflation to Growth Development Policy Analysis No 6 Washington , D C
