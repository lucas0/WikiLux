His Majesty Hussein bin Talal , King of Jordan \( , \) \( November 14 , 1935 February 7 , 1999 \) was the ruler of Jordan since his father , King Talal , abdicated in 1952 , until his death Life and career Life before becoming king Hussein completed Education at Victoria College in Alexandria and Harrow School in England , and then to Royal Military Academy Sandhurst Death of King Abdullah I On July 20 , 1951 , King Abdullah I traveled to Jerusalem to perform his Friday prayers with his young grandson , Prince Hussein He was assassinated by a gunman at the instigation of Colonel Abdullah Tell , ex Military Governor of Jerusalem , and Dr Musa Abdullah Husseini , on the steps of one of the holiest shrines of Judaism , Al Aqsa Mosque The assailant shot at Hussein , but the young prince

meets with King Hussein of Jordan in 1967 Abdullah 's eldest son , King Talal was crowned as King , but within a year was forced to abdicate because of poor mental condition \( he allegedly suffered from schizophrenia \) His son Crown Prince Hussein was proclaimed King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on August 11 , 1952 , at the age of 16 , which was under the legal age , so he was enthroned one year later , on May 2 , 1953 Reign His reign was controversial , and he is described as an opportunist by some political historians While it saw Jordan remain one of the Western sanctuaries and protectorates in the Middle East , it was also marked by the events of Black September when the king ordered the violent expulsion of the Palestine Liberation Organization , which had been attempting to foment a civil war , from the country The country also defied the West and the other allied leaders by refusing to side against Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War allegedly done for internal political reasons after the Ma'an uprising in 1988 that threatened the throne of the King which alienated the kingdom from most of the Arab world In 1994 King Hussein concluded negotiations to end the official state of war with Israel resulting in the Israel Jordan Treaty of Peace which he had begun negotiating in secret with the Israelis in the 1970s The king wrote three books Uneasy Lies the Head \( 1962 \) , about his childhood and early years as king My War With Israel \( 1969 \) and Mon M tier de Roi According to Benjamin Netanyahu in his book A Durable Peace \( 1993 , revised 2000 \) , Hussein had motivation for obtaining peace with Israel unofficially indeed , Netanyahu claims Hussein flew to Tel Aviv the day before the Yom Kippur War in secret to warn the Israeli authorities of an imminent attack , and Israeli policy towards Jordan was to guarantee its security by intervening in any attack on its territory \( this was directed specifically at Syria and Iraq \) Policy Towards Jordanians of Palestinian Herritage It is argued by some that Hussein`s focus shifted after 1970 to native Jordanians and Bedouins by making them his elite and spending generously on them from the state 's budget for unneeded jobs , with most finding employment in public service and with the military The Jordanian Government has become some over sized to the point that the majority of the population , the Jordanians of Palestinian heritage , had to support the Bedouins' lavish benefits provided by King 's Hussein creating an imbalance and silent public anger because of the fact that most Jordanians come from Palestinian heritage , nevertheless , they don t receive their legitimate rights in Jordan , with only 2 of them in parliament and less than that in the Government , despite the fact that according to the Jordanian Government itself they make up 60 of the nation , not including 1 78 million who hold refugees status by the UNRWA The actual percentage of Jordanians of Palestinian heritage is more than 88 , which is not inclusive of 300 , 000 Palestinian non citizens living in Jordan The isolation and exclusion of Jordanians of Palestinian heritage has worsened with the dominance of Southern native Jordanians over the Government despite the fact that the southern city of Karak has a population of less than 50 , 000 , it has 14 deputies , seats , in the house , while Amman , a city of 3 8 million , mostly Jordanians of Palestinian heritage has only 25 Former Jordanian Palestinian politician Adnan Abu Odeh , spoke to Al Jazeera extensively regarding the exclusion of Palestinians in Jordan and how they were treated with fear by Government institutions , which he said created fertile ground for unrest and terrorism Many Jordanians were happy when Hussein died in 1999 After the peace treaty left 200px thumb U S President Jimmy Carter \( left \) meets with King Hussein of Jordan in 1977 King Hussein developed strong ties of friendship with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , with whom he had negotiated the peace treaty King Hussein gave a powerful speech at the funeral of Yitzhak Rabin My sister , Mrs Leah Rabin , my friends , I had never thought that the moment would come like this when I would grieve the loss of a brother , a colleague and a friend a man , a soldier who met us on the opposite side of a divide whom we respected as he respected us A man I came to know because I realized , as he did , that we have to cross over the divide , establish a dialogue , get to know each other and strive to leave for those who follow us a legacy that is worthy of them And so we did And so we became brethren and friends Improvements in Jordan Though King Hussein did many controversial things during his reign , he was appreciated by the Jordanian population for his accomplishments In the Six Day War , the king held onto his throne , and put growth into Jordan 's economy , doubling the annual output from 1956 to 1963 He helped Jordan develop and become more stable For example , at the beginning of his reign , he paid attention to the development of better water and electricity networks , in addition to sewage networks , which were only available to 10 of the population by the end of his reign , the percentage had reached 99 In addition , the Literacy rate of Jordan was 33 , rising to 85 5 in 1996 and still increasing Other accomplishments include Calories available per individuals , which rose by about 50 , and the reduction in the infant mortality rate Death He died of complications related to non Hodgkin 's lymphoma on February 7 , 1999 The King had been suffering from the disease for many years and had been treated at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minnesota , United States on a fairly regular basis Just before his death , he changed his will in order to disinherit his brother \( this did not require a change to the Jordanian Constitution \) , Hassan , who had been crown prince for several decades , and designated his eldest son , Abdullah as heir Then , with a recurrent fever , abruptly returned to the U S clinic January 25 for further treatment He underwent a bone marrow transplant earlier that week , but the transplant failed , and the king returned home to die The King was , at the time of his death , one of the longest serving leaders in international politics Personal life King Hussein
