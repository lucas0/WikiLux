the superiority of the traditional family form have been challenged by the results of empirical research Early in the Twentieth Century , it was widely believed that traditional family settings were necessary in order for children to adjust well Since the 1970s , it has become increasingly clear that it is family processes \( such as the quality of parenting , the psychosocial well being of parents , the quality of and satisfaction with relationships within the family , and the level of co operation and harmony between parents \) that contribute to determining children s well being and outcomes , rather than family structures , per se , such as the number , gender , sexuality and co habitation status of parents Elizabeth Short , Damien W Riggs , Amaryll Perlesz , Rhonda Brown ,

Society is replete with role models from whom children and adolescents can learn about socially prescribed male and female roles Indeed , the scientific research that has directly compared outcomes for children with gay and lesbian parents with outcomes for children with heterosexual parents has been remarkably consistent in showing that lesbian and gay parents are every bit as fit and capable as heterosexual parents , and their children are as psychologically healthy and well adjusted as children reared by heterosexual parents , Case No S147999 in the Supreme Court of the State of

considerable legal discrimination and inequity remain significant challenges for these families These data have demonstrated no risk to children as a result of growing up in a family with 1 or more

credible empirical research suggests otherwise If gay , lesbian , or bisexual parents were inherently less capable than otherwise comparable heterosexual parents , their children would evidence problems regardless of the type of sample This pattern clearly has not been observed Given the consistent failures in this research literature to disprove the null hypothesis , the burden of empirical proof is on those who argue that the children of sexual minority parents fare worse than the children of heterosexual parents Canadian Psychological Association is concerned that some are mis interpreting the findings of psychological research to support their positions , when their positions are more accurately based on other systems of belief or values According to the Maine Chapter of American Academy of Pediatrics those who claim that children need a biologically related mother and father to flourish are either ignorant of the scientific literature or are misrepresenting it or both Dr Dan Summers , American Academy of Pediatrics , Maine Chapter Literature indicates that parents financial , psychological and physical well being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union Canadian Psychological Association Marriage of Same Sex Couples 2006 Position Statement Canadian Psychological Association Most of the studies appeared in rigorously peer reviewed and highly selective journals , whose standards represent expert consensus on generally accepted social scientific standards for research on child and adolescent development Professor Judith Stacey , of New York University , stated Rarely is there as much consensus in any area of social science as in the case of gay parenting , which is why the American Academy of Pediatrics and all of the major professional organizations with expertise in child welfare have issued reports and resolutions in support of gay and lesbian parental rights

of Salfordhttp www imr salford ac uk social 20work membership stephen 20hicks shtml questions the value of trying to establish that lesbian or gay parents are defective or suitable , arguing such positions are flawed because they are informed by ideologies that either oppose or support such families In Hicks' view , Instead of asking whether gay parenting is bad for kids , I think we should ask how contemporary discourses of sexuality maintain the very idea that lesbian and gay families are essentially different and , indeed , deficient But , in order to ask this , I think that we need a wider range of research into lesbian and gay parenting More work of this sort will help us to ask more complex questions about forms of parenting that continue to offer some novel and challenging approaches to family life Research that has uncovered interesting differences in child outcomes indirectly connected with having lesbian or gay parents notes that the connections are not causal , and that there are no differences between heterosexual and lesbian or gay families that are of social concern \( How \) Does the Sexual Orientation of Parent 's Matter \? Sexuality of children Children raised by same sex parents are not more likely to have same sex orientations themselves American Psychological Assotiation Lesbian Gay Parenting According to Stacey Biblarz We know very little yet about how parents influence the development of their children 's sexual identities or how these intersect with gender An important longitudinal British study \( Tasker Golombok , 1997 \) compared children brought up by lesbian and straight mothers after divorce On the basis of interviews with the children in young adulthood , the study reported no differences in sexual attractions or identities , but significantly more daughters of lesbians , but not sons , had considered or engaged in homosexuality The study had a small sample , the confounding effects of divorce , and did not control for number of parents The newer Dutch study , however , compared a larger sample of preadolescent children raised by planned lesbian and heterosexual couples and reported compatible data \( Bos et al , 2006 \) It found no differences in heterosexual identity scores for sons with two mothers Daughters of lesbian mothers , however , scored 0 75 SD lower on heterosexual identity than daughters of heterosexual couples We need comparable data for children reared by single heterosexual mothers or exclusively by men to distinguish the impact of gender from sexual identity here Did having exclusively female parents or lesbian parents reduce preadolescent daughters' expectations for future heterosexual relationships \? The fact that lesbian parenting did not diminish heterosexual desires in sons supports research finding greater fixity in male and fluidity in female sexual desires over the life course \( Butler , 2005 Diamond , 2008 \) The lower heterosexual identity scores of these girls \( but not their brothers \) might reflect this gender difference \( How \) Does the Sexual Orientation of Parent 's Matter \?
