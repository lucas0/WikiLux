Antoine Prior \( or Priore \) \( April 10 , 1912 May 9 , 1983 \) was an Italian electric engineer , known for inventing a controversial electromagnetic device that he claimed could cure cancer Medical experts dismissed his views as quackery Camp , John \( 1973 \) Magic , Myth and Medicine Priory Press Limited p 183 Many other experiences scientists insist that Priore , who has no medical qualifications , is hoodwinking the medical profession as surely as did Elisha Perkins with his Metallic Tractors in the early nineteenth century Career Prior was born in Trieste , Italy Prior received training in electrical engineering and was a radar technician for the Italian Navy \( Perisse , 1984 \) He was a prisoner of the German Nazi occupation of Bordeaux , France , until he was rescued by the French resistance in 1944 \( Bird , 1984 \) It is said by internet sources that in 1944 Priore noticed some oranges that had been left next to some electrical equipment These oranges remained in a fresh state while others not near the electrical equipment became rotten and putrid Antoine Priore The Bordeaux Magnetic Machine Priore worked for 25 years \( between 1950 and 1975 \) in Bordeaux , and built a series of electromagnetic devices producing a strong magnetic field of 600 gauss \( 60 mT \) or more for the purpose of treating cancer and disease His last device was funded by the French government with the help of one time Prime Minister of France Jacques Chaban Delmas Prior also built a large device \( M 600 \) for the purpose of treating people with cancer \( Graille , 1984 \) Prior reported to have treated a number of animals with cancer with his device , but it broke down before it could be applied to human patients \( Graille , 1984 \) Prior claimed to have cured a number of terminal cancer patients with his earlier devices \( Bird , 1984 \) Prior 's research attracted the attention of the French media in 1965 who dubbed it L'affaire Priore In 1965 , one event exposed possible foul play in Prior 's experimental research involving English mice Mice with experimental cancers sent to Prior from the Chester Beatty Institute in England lead to controversy over his research After Prior exposed the mice to radiation from his devices , they were sent back to the Institute Scientists from the Institute claimed the mice returned to them were not genuine because they rejected new cancer grafts One scientist with the Institute , Pierette Chateaurenaud Duprat , retorted the claim stating the mice showed signs of immunity to the cancers they were originally grafted with \( Graille , 1984 \) Prior 's colleagues supported his research until his death in 1983 Immunologist Raymond Pautrizel and Robert Courier , former secretary of the French Academy of Sciences , published a series of notes on Prior 's research in the proceedings of the French Academy \( Graille , 1984 \) Pautrizel , an apologist , classified Prior 's methodology as immunological in nature , since animals inoculated with deadly doses of parasites were reportedly healed with Prior radiation According to Bird \( 1984 \) , a supporter , Priore 's methodology was also characterized by boosting subjects' immune systems , allowing them to heal themselves of incurable diseases Antoine Prior died on May 9 , 1983 of a stroke \( Perisse , 1984 \) Jean Michel Graille , a French journalist , met with Raymond Pautrizel and wrote a book on the Priore affair , Dossier Priore Critical reception Prior was accused of manipulating his scientific data by the French Academy of Sciences French journalists also accused Prior of not understanding his own technique for treating cancer and disease Prior never exposed his exact method , believing others would only steal it for themselves Members of the French Academy of Sciences and media alike seriously questioned the legitimacy of Prior 's research , with many accusing him of fraud \( Graille , 1984 \) The U S Office of Naval Research evaluated Prior 's patents The patents seemed deliberately made unclear , leaving little information to ascertain the mechanical and electromagnetic workings of Prior 's devices \(
