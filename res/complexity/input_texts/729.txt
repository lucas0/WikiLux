The Homeridae were a family , clan or professional lineage claiming descent from the legendary Greek epic poet Homer The origin of the name seems obvious in classical Greek the word should mean children of Homer An analogous name , Asclepiadae , identified a clan or guild of medical practitioners as children of Asclepius However , since the existence of the Homeridae is authenticated while that of Homer is not , and since Greek homeros is a common noun meaning hostage , it was suggested even in ancient times that the Homeridae were in reality children \( or descendants \) of hostages The natural further step is to argue that Homer , the supposed founder , is a mythical figure , a mere back formation , deriving his name from that of the later guild Evidence on the Homeridae relates to the late sixth , fifth and fourth centuries BC , after which nothing more is heard of them The first contemporary mention of this group is in a poem of about 485 BC by Pindar Later contemporary references come in fourth century texts , in the works of Plato and Isocrates In one of his essays , written around 350 BC , Isocrates says At a slightly earlier date Plato makes a similar comment There are two further mentions , in Plato 's Republic and in the Ion In the latter the rhapsode Ion claims that he should be crowned by the Homeridae for his work in promoting the poems of Homer Plato , Republic 599d Ion 530d It is usual in work on Plato to translate Homeridae as admirers of Homer , but there is nothing to support this interpretation Supplementary information , of uncertain validity , is found in later Greek antiquarian writings A scholarly commentary on Pindar 's poem gives the following details The name Homeridae originally meant descendants of Homer , who maintained the tradition of singing his poems , but afterwards was applied to rhapsodes who did not claim literal descent from him One famous member , Cynaethus of Chios , was at the centre of a group who were specially active in composing new poems and attaching them to Homer 's works Cynaethus himself was the author of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo and was the first to perform Homeric poems at Syracuse Scholia on Pindar , Nemean Odes 2 1 A second source is Harpocration , who names three early writers of Greek local history whose works are now lost Acusilaus and Hellanicus of Lesbos apparently stated that the Homeridae were named after Homer , while Seleucus said that they were not Harpocration , Lexicon s v Homeridae Finally , the geographer Strabo says that the people of Chios adduced the Homeridae as evidence that Homer came from Chios which implies , though Strabo does not say it , that the Homeridae , too , came from Chios Strabo , Geography 14 1 35 It seems from this evidence that the Homeridae were a guild of oral performers \( rhapsodes , as implied by Pindar 's phrase singers of stitched words \) who claimed to inherit Homer 's tradition and performed poems ascribed to Homer , no doubt including the Iliad and Odyssey They also developed stories about how the poems had originated , such as Homer 's dream of Helen Like other rhapsodes , they travelled widely , but they were perhaps based on Chios Certain Homeridae were active in adding new poems to the tradition Incidentally , some people believed these attributions Thucydides , though not easily fooled , quotes from a version of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo similar to the text now known and confidently ascribes it to Homer Thucydides , Histories 3 104 Notes Bibliography Walter Burkert , 'Kynaithos , Polycrates and the Homeric Hymn to Apollo' in Arktouros Hellenic studies presented to B M W Knox ed G W Bowersock , W Burkert , M C J Putnam \( Berlin De Gruyter , 1979 \) pp 53 62 , pp 167 175 Category Oral epic poets Category Homer la Homeridae
