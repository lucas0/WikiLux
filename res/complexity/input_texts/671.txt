History Now Charles R Geisst says , in a Darwinist age , Vanderbilt developed a reputation as a plunderer who took no prisoners Hal Bridges said that the term represented the idea that business leaders in the United States from about 1865 to 1900 were , on the whole , a set of avaricious rascals who habitually cheated and robbed investors and consumers , corrupted government , fought ruthlessly among themselves , and in general carried on predatory activities comparable to those of the robber barons of medieval Europe Hal Bridges , The robber baron concept in American history Business History Review 32 1 \( 1958 \) 1 13 , page 1 The term combines the pejorative senses of criminal \( robber \) and aristocrat \( barons having no legitimate role in a republic \) Hostile cartoonists might dress the offenders in royal garb to underscore the offense against democracy Worth Robert Miller , Populist cartoons an illustrated history of the third party movement in the 1890s \( 2011 \) p 13 Criticism 1860s 1920s Historian John Tipple has examined the writings of the 50 most influential analysts who used the robber baron model in the 1865 1914 period He argues The originators of the Robber Baron concept were not the injured , the poor , the faddists , the jealous , or a dispossessed elite , but rather a frustrated group of observers led at last by protracted years of harsh depression to believe that the American dream of abundant prosperity for all was a hopeless myth Thus the creation of the Robber Baron stereotype seems to have been the product of an impulsive popular attempt to explain the shift in the structure of American society in terms of the obvious Rather than make the effort to understand the intricate processes of change , most critics appeared to slip into the easy vulgarizations of the devil view of history which ingenuously assumes that all human misfortunes can be traced to the machinations of an easily located set of villains in this case , the big businessmen of America This assumption was clearly implicit in almost all of the criticism of the period John Tipple , The anatomy of prejudice Origins of the robber baron legend Business History Review 33 4 \( 1959 \) 510 523 , quoting pp 510 , 521 1930s 1970s American historian Matthew Josephson further popularized the term during the Great Depression in a 1934 book Matthew Josephson , The Robber Barons The Great American Capitalists , 1861 1901 , New York Harcourt , Brace and Company , 1934 Josephson alleged that , like the German princes , American big businessmen amassed huge fortunes immorally , unethically , and unjustly The theme was popular during the 1930s amid public scorn for big business Historian Steve Fraser says the mood was sharply hostile toward big business Biographies of Mellon , Carnegie and Rockefeller were often laced with moral censure , warning that tories of industry were a threat to democracy and that parasitism , aristocratic pretension and tyranny have always trailed in the wake of concentrated wealth , whether accumulated dynastically or more impersonally by the faceless corporation This scholarship , and the cultural persuasion of which it was an expression , drew on a deeply rooted sensibility partly religious , partly egalitarian and democratic that stretched back to William Jennings Bryan , Andrew Jackson and Tom Paine Steve Fraser , The Misunderstood Robber Baron On Cornelius Vanderbilt T J Stiles 's The First Tycoon is a gilded portrait of the robber baron Cornelius Vanderbilt , The Nation Nov 11 , 2009 However a counterattack by academic historians began as the Depression ended Business historian Allan Nevins challenged this view of American big businessmen by advocating the Industrial Statesman thesis Nevins , in his John D Rockefeller The Heroic Age of American Enterprise \( 2 vols , 1940 \) , took on Josephson He argued that while Rockefeller may have engaged in some unethical and illegal business practices , this should not overshadow his bringing order to the industrial chaos of the day Gilded Age capitalists , according to Nevins , sought to impose order and stability on competitive business , and that their work made the United States the foremost economy by the 20th century Allan Nevins , John D Rockefeller The Heroic Age of American Enterprise , 2 vols , New York ,

distinction between robber barons and captains of industry Students will uncover some of the less honorable deeds as well as the shrewd business moves and highly charitable acts of the great industrialists and financiers It has been argued that only because such people were able to amass great amounts of capital could our country become the world 's greatest industrial power Some of the actions of these men , which could only happen in a period of economic laissez faire , resulted in poor conditions for workers , but in the end , may also have enabled our present day standard of
