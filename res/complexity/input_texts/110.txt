May 16 2005 The Los Angeles County coroner concluded that Eliza Jane had died of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia as a result of untreated AIDS Maggiore had not taken medication to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV to her daughter during pregnancy , and Eliza Jane was never tested for HIV during her lifetime A Mother 's Denial , a Daughter 's Death Article from L A Times A toxicologist \( and AIDS dissident \) retained by Maggiore to review the autopsy report disagreed with the coroner 's conclusion , stating that he believed Eliza Jane 's death was due to an allergic reaction to

export clothing company , Alessi International , based in Tuscany In 1992 , as part of a routine medical exam , Maggiore tested HIV positive Following her diagnosis , Maggiore became involved in volunteer work for a number of AIDS charities , including AIDS Project Los Angeles , L A Shanti and Women at Risk However , following some anomalous HIV test results \( negative , positive and indeterminate \) and subsequently an interaction with prominent AIDS dissident Peter Duesberg in 1994 , she began to question whether HIV did in fact cause AIDS Maggiore came to believe that her positive test may have been due to flu shots , pregnancy , or a common viral infection In 1995 , Maggiore left the clothing business to work as a freelance consultant for US government export programs

including decisions to avoid HIV medications for themselves or their children Maggiore herself drew criticism for breast feeding her children ABC News Primetime Live special report breast feeding has been shown to increase the risk of mother to child transmission of HIV , although this conclusion has not been accepted by many AIDS dissidents In a 2005 article in the L A Times , Maggiore claimed to be in excellent health without taking anti retroviral treatment In a 2002 article entitled My Bout of So Called AIDS , Maggiore wrote that she had been diagnosed with a cervical condition \( a Grade 3 Pap smear with cervical dysplasia \) that would qualify her for an AIDS diagnosis Maggiore 's doctors recommended further evaluation with colposcopy Maggiore instead followed a naturopathic program and had a third Pap test performed by another doctor under an assumed name , which she wrote was normal My Bout of So Called AIDS Article by Christine Maggiore Accessed 5 Dec 2006 Maggiore states that

Technical report perinatal human immunodeficiency virus testing and prevention of transmission Pediatrics 2000 106 \( 6 \) However , given the known and unknown risks of antiretroviral use in

and unknown benefits and risks of therapy in a noncoercive environment National Institutes of Health recommendations on HIV therapy during pregnancy Accessed 4 Dec 2006 Maggiore also breast fed her children , despite evidence that breast feeding can also transmit HIV from mother to child Her youngest daughter , Eliza Jane , was never tested for HIV , nor did she receive any of the recommended childhood vaccines Maggiore discussed her beliefs as an AIDS dissident on Air America in March 2005 , stating that our children have excellent records of health They 've never had respiratory problems

, Eliza Jane became ill with a runny nose She was seen by a physician from the family 's pediatric practice , who documented a normal physical exam Several days later , Maggiore took Eliza Jane to see another pediatrician , Dr Jay Gordon , who felt she had a mild ear infection Reportedly , Gordon was aware of Maggiore 's HIV status , but did not have Eliza Jane tested for HIV and was not concerned about opportunistic infection When Eliza Jane failed to improve , Maggiore took her to see Dr Philip Incao , a holistic practitioner and board member of Maggiore 's dissident organization Alive Well AIDS Alternatives Incao stated that Eliza Jane appeared mildly ill no way I considered her in danger she did not act as a patient acts if she 's severely ill or in danger On May 14 2005 , Incao prescribed amoxicillin for a presumed ear infection The following day , Eliza Jane became lethargic and vomited several times While Maggiore was on the phone to Dr Incao , Eliza Jane collapsed and stopped breathing She was rushed by ambulance to Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys , California Physicians attempted to rescusitate Eliza Jane , but were unsuccessful she was pronounced dead at 5 40 AM on May 16 2005 Autopsy Report on Eliza Jane Scovill Cause of death An autopsy was performed The Los Angeles County coroner found that Eliza Jane was markedly underweight and underheight , consistent with a chronic illness , and that she had had pronounced atrophy of her thymus and other lymphatic organs Examination of her lungs showed infection with Pneumocystis jiroveci , a common opportunistic pathogen in people with AIDS The post mortem examination of Eliza Jane 's brain showed changes consistent with HIV encephalitis protein components of the HIV virus itself were identified in Eliza Jane 's brain tissue via immunohistochemistry Based on the clinical information , the immunohistochemical documentation of HIV in Eliza Jane 's brain , the evidence of pronounced immunosuppression , and the isolation of the opportunistic pathogen Pneumocystis jiroveci from Eliza Jane 's lungs , the coroner concluded that Eliza Jane had died of Pneumocystis pneumonia in the setting of advanced AIDS This conclusion was described by the coroner as unequivocal Maggiore rejected the coroner 's conclusion , ascribing it to political bias and attacking the personal credibility of the coroner , Dr James Ribe Justice For E J , website maintained by David Crowe of the Alberta Reappraising AIDS Society , accessed 5 September 2006 Maggiore retained a board certified toxicologist

Bayati 's review of Eliza Jane Scovill 's autopsy , accessed 5 September 2006 Maggiore embraced Dr Al Bayati 's conclusion that a reaction to amoxicillin was responsible , stating , I believe the unfortunate irony in this situation is that the one time that we were asked to and that we complied with mainstream medicine , we inadvertently gave our daughter something that took her life Critics have dismissed Al Bayati 's report as both biased and medically unsound Christine Maggiore AIDS naysayer , accessed 5 September 2006 Rebuttal to Dr Mohammed Al Bayati 's report , by Nicholas Bennett , accessed 5 September 2006 Both the L A Times and ABC PrimeTime Live consulted independent experts in pathology about Eliza Jane 's case these experts agreed unequivocally with the coroner 's conclusion that AIDS and PCP were the cause of death , and rejected Dr Al Bayati 's report Criticism and controversy Following Eliza Jane Scovill 's death , Maggiore 's beliefs have become points of controversy Medical evidence suggests that the risk of HIV transmission could have been reduced substantially by taking antiretroviral medication during pregnancy and childhood Maggiore , however , holds fast to her belief that HIV does not cause AIDS , and that Eliza Jane died of a reaction to amoxicillin Maggiore has also described much of the major journalistic coverage of her story as biased or inaccurate She submitted a letter to the L A Times alleging factual errors and omissions in their articles on Eliza Jane the Times did not print the letter , stating that If facts in an article are wrong , a correction would be published However , no correction is warranted in this case Maggiore 's view of the L A Times article , accessed 5 September 2006 Others point to the weight of evidence , which suggests that Eliza Jane acquired AIDS from Maggiore perinatally or via breast feeding , that Eliza 's HIV infection might have been prevented had Maggiore taken antiretroviral drugs or avoided breast feeding , that Eliza Jane 's death was due to complications of AIDS , and that her death may have been preventable with proper medical care Eliza Jane 's death has been described as a concrete example of the human harm that can result from pseudoscientific beliefs such as AIDS denialism Speaking at the 16th International AIDS Conference , Dr John Moore argued infants whose HIV infected mothers listen to AIDS denialists never got the chance to make their own decisions The Maggiore case received wide publicity Christine Maggiore is a person who s proselytized against the use of antiretrovirals to prevent HIV AIDS She s a classic AIDS denialist , and she gave birth to a child who died at age three late last year of an AIDS related infection The coroner s report clearly
