The range of sports played in New Zealand reflect to a large extent its British colonial heritage Some of the most popular sports in New Zealand , namely rugby , cricket and netball are primarily played in British Commonwealth countries New Zealand 's most popular sports are rugby \( primarily rugby union but also rugby league \) , soccer , cricket , and netball \( the top ranking female sport by participation \) golf , tennis , rowing and a variety of water sports , particularly sailing Snow sports such as skiing and snowboarding are also popular Equestrian sports are highly popular especially with women and participation numbers begin to overhaul rugby and other contact sports in older age groups New Zealand equestrian sportsmen , sportswomen and horses make their mark in the world \( Mark Todd was chosen as international Eventer of the 20th Century \) Participation rates Data on participation rates in sport in New Zealand is published by SPARC \( Sport and Recreation New Zealand \) SPARC 's data can be found at Participation in Sport Top Sports and Physical Activities SPARC Facts complete \( pdf \) This data relates to the period 1997 to 2001 Some care needs to be taken when interpreting it For example , 'Top Sports and Physical Activities' gives Rugby Union as the fifth most popular sport for New Zeland adult men with 137 , 100 participants , and soccer as twelfth most popular with 83 , 800 Neither Rugby Union nor Soccer appear in the top 15 sports for adult women On the other hand 'Participation in Sport' states that 158 , 100 New Zealand adults participated in Rugby Union in the previous 12 months , and 143 , 300 New Zealand adults participated in Soccer A difference in 60 , 000 seems quite large The top 5 sports played by boys \( 5 17 \) in clubs are Soccer \( 17 \) Rugby Union \( 16 \) Swimming \( 14 \) Cricket \( 8 \) Hockey \( 8 \) The top 5 sports played by girls \( 5 17 \) in clubs are Swimming \( 17 \) Netball \( 13 \) Horse riding \( 10 \) Tennis \( 8 \) Soccer \( 6 \) The top 5 sports played by men are Golf \( 26 \) Cricket \( 15 \) Tennis \( 14 \) Touch football \( 14 \) Rugby union \( 11 \) The top 5 sports played by women are Netball \( 11 \) Tennis \( 10 \) Golf \( 9 \) Touch football \( 7 \) Skiing \( 7 \) Rugby union Rugby is not class bound in New Zealand , as in the United Kingdom where it is often associated with middle and upper classes Many New Zealanders associate it with their national identity , and it has the largest spectator following of all sports in New Zealand Rugby may crudely be said to occupy the place occupied by soccer in most other countries New Zealand 's national rugby team , the All Blacks , has the best winning record of any national team in the world The All Blacks traditionally perform a haka a traditional M ori challenge at the start of international matches This practice has been mimiced by several other national teams , notably the national rugby league team and the basketball teams Outside of test matches , there are two widely followed competitions The National Provincial Championship \( NPC \) involves only New Zealand teams and occurs mainly during the winter months The Super 12 , which will become the Super 14 in 2006 , is a more recent competition involving teams from New Zealand , Australia and South Africa Cricket Cricket is the highest profile summer sport in New Zealand The national competition is not nearly as widely followed as the case with rugby , but international matches are watched with interest by a large proportion of the population Historically , the national cricket team has not been a successful as the national rugby team New Zealand played its first test in 1930 but had to wait until 1956 to win its first test The national team began to have more success in the 1970s and 1980s New Zealand 's most famous cricketer , the fast bowler Richard Hadlee who was the first bowler to take 400 wickets in test cricket , came from this era Netball Netball is similar to Basketball and is primarily played by women It has high levels of participation and is popular as a spectator sport Soccer Soccer , more generally known as football in other countries , occupies a similar position to that which it occupies in the United States it is the most popular of the football codes in terms of participation \( Participation in Sport data from SPARC \) \) \) but is not particularly popular as a spectator sport Club and provincial games attract few spectators , although overseas competitions , particularly the English Premier League and the , are widely followed Olympic Games The country is internationally recognised as achieving extremely well on a medals to population ratio at Olympic Games and Commonwealth Games See , for example , New Zealand Olympic medalists and New Zealand at the 2004 Summer Olympics New Zealand 's most celebrated Olympian is probably middle distance runner Peter Snell , who three gold medals and broke several world records during the 1960s Yachting , America 's Cup Auckland hosted the last two America 's Cup regattas \( 2000 and 2003 \) In 2000 , Team New Zealand successfully defended the trophy they won in 1995 in San Diego , but in 2003 they lost to a team headed by Ernesto Bertarelli of Switzerland whose Alinghi was skippered by Russell Coutts , the expatriate Kiwi who helmed the victorious Black Magic in 1995 and New Zealand in 2000 Coutts and Brad Butterworth , along with several other Team New Zealand members , defected to Bertarelli 's Alinghi team , taking with them a wealth of experience that allowed the new team to win the America 's Cup on the first challenge Coutts has since been dismissed from the Alinghi team he fought a court battle with Bertarelli to allow him to sail in the 2007 America 's Cup contest in Spain , but reached a settlement that will keep him out of that contest Gliding New Zealand is world famous among glider pilots for hosting the 1995 Gliding World Cup at Omarama in North Otago near the centre of the South Island The Southern Alps are known for the excellent wave soaring conditions Steve Fossett has recently tried to beat the world gliding altitude record there \( See external links \) Orienteering Orienteering is a popular sport in New Zealand that combines cross country running with land navigation skills in the woods Variations of the sport popular in New Zealand include bicycle orienteering , ski orienteering , and rogaines Orienteering is a very popular sport for youth and juniors , and New Zealand regularly sends competitors to both the World Orienteering Championships and the Junior World Orienteering Championships Orienteering in New Zealand is organized by the New Zealand Orienteering Federation New Zealand national teams National team names Somewhat bizarrely the national teams are given proper name The national men 's rugby team is known as the All Blacks , rather than the NZ rugby team and the national women 's netball team is known as the Silver Ferns Historically , rugby and netball dominated team sport in New Zealand , and the national teams of other sports have acquired names which have been formed with reference to these two \( see list below \) The women 's rugby team is known as the 'Black Ferns' , rather than the 'All Silvers' Some of these names seem to have arisen as genuine nick names \( e g Tall Blacks , Wheel Blacks \) , and some are neologisms developed by marketing droids in sports organisations for commercial purposes \( e g Black Sticks \( hockey \) , Black Caps \( cricket \) \) It is not possible to register words like 'rugby' and 'cricket' as trade names , nor to claim exculsive use of black shirts or the silver fern , but new names , and specific designs , can be registered Hence 'All Blacks' , 'Black Caps' , and so on are registered trademarks of their respective owners A name is also presumably supposeed to help 'brand identification' , and increase the profile of the sport The nadir of this trend was the proposal by New Zealand Badminton to name their teams 'Black Cocks' The men 's national soccer team is called the 'All Whites' , and they play in all white At the time the national soccer team was formed an all black strip would not have been allowed Two notable exceptions to the 'All Ferns' naming schema are the Kiwis \( men 's Rugby League \) and SWANZ \( women 's soccer \) National team colours New Zealand 's national sporting colours are not the colours of its flag , but are black and white \( silver \) The silver fern is a national emblem worn by New Zealanders representing their country in sport National team names Badminton Black Cocks Men 's Basketball Tall Blacks Women 's Basketball Tall Ferns Men 's Cricket Black Caps Women
