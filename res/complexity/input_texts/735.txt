The Woodville Karst Plain Project or WKPP , grew out of a cave diving research and exploration group established in 1985 \( by Bill Gavin and Bill Main , later joined by Parker Turner , Lamar English and Bill McFaden , at the time the chairman of the NACD Exploration and Survey Committee \) to map the underwater cave systems underlying the Woodville Karst Plain , a area that runs from Tallahassee , Florida , U S to the Gulf of Mexico and includes numerous first magnitude springs , including Wakulla Springs , and the Leon Sinks Cave System , the longest underwater cave in the United States WKPP is the only organization currently allowed to dive these caves which are all on State , Federal , or private land due to the extreme nature of the systems and the discipline required to safely explore them , although these caves were explored extensively prior to the establishment of the WKPP This is a controversial issue , as many people think these caves should be open to the public or , at the least , to other qualified cave diving groups and individuals Recently , during 2007 , one State owned entrance of the Leon Sinks cave system has been reopened to other qualified cave divers The technology developed by the WKPP , from diver propulsion to decompression , has become the basis for much of what is now done in military and scientific diving WKPP divers hold every distance record in underwater cave diving WKPP director Casey McKinlay and his regular dive buddy , Jarrod Jablonski hold the world 's record for the greatest distance from air in a cave dive each way The data gathered by WKPP divers has allowed planners a better definition of what to expect from the underground aquifer system and how best to handle issues relating to such things as surface water runoff and other nonpoint source pollution issues WKPP mapping has resulted in the State of Florida and the U S Department of Agriculture establishing a greenway surrounding the Leon Sinks cave system and a protection zone for Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Park , as well as numerous improvements in water management district operations , DOT road building , and development planning DIR diving The WKPP is notable for its part in the development of cave diving techniques and team diving protocols , the DIR method of scuba diving \( which is the basis for the teaching methodology of Global Underwater Explorers \) and the use of the Halcyon PVR BASC and RB80 rebreathers DIR , an acronym for 'Doing It Right' , is a holistic approach to scuba diving According to the DIR approach fundamental skills , teamwork , environmental awareness , and the use of highly optimized and streamlined equipment configuration are the primary fundamentals of diving DIR proponents argue that through these essential elements , safety is improved by standardizing equipment configuration and procedures for preventing and dealing with emergencies , and out of air emergencies in particular Current research On May 20 , 2007 , divers set off from Turner Sink to try and find a connection but were unable to when the cave became impassable after On July 28 , 2007 , divers explored of new passage before discovering an exploration line from Wakulla Springs On Dec 15 , 2007 , WKPP divers Casey McKinlay and Jarrod Jablonski completed a traverse from Turner Sink to Wakulla Springs , covering a distance of nearly This traverse took approximately 7 hours , followed by 15 hours of decompression Current projects include exploring , surveying , and mapping of the Wakulla Leon Sinks Cave system , as well as coordinating between private , state , and federal agencies to help protect the flooded caves of the Woodville Karst Plain References
