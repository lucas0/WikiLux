Cronobacter is the officially recognised bacterial genus name for the organism which before 2007 was named Enterobacter sakazakii The name E sakazakii should no longer be used as the genus name Cronobacter has been accepted in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology , along with the description of the new species It is a Gram negative , rod shaped , pathogenic bacterium The majority of Cronobacter cases are in adults , and additionally it is associated with a rare cause of invasive infection of infants with historically high case fatality rates \( 40 80 \) Free full text In infants it can cause bacteraemia , meningitis and necrotising enterocolitis Some neonatal Cronobacter \( E sakazakii \) infections have been associated with the use of powdered infant formula with some strains able to survive in a desiccated state for more than two years However not all cases have been linked to contaminated infant formula In November 2011 , several shipments of Kotex tampons were recalled due to a Cronobacter \( E sakazakii \) contamination All Cronobacter species , except C condimenti , have been linked retrospectively to clinical cases of infection in either adults or infants However multilocus sequence typing has shown that the majority of neonatal meningitis cases in the past 30 years , across 6 countries have been associated with only one genetic lineage of the species Cronobacter sakazakii called 'Sequence Type 4' or 'ST4' , and therefore this clone appears to be of greatest concern with infant infections The bacterium is ubiquitous being isolated from a range of environments and foods , and the majority of Cronobacter cases are in the adult population However it is the association with intrinsically or extrinsically contaminated powdered formula which has attracted the main attention According to multilocus sequence analysis \( MLSA \) the genus originated 40 MYA , and the most clinically significant species , C sakazakii , was distinguishable 15 23 MYA Taxonomy E sakazakii was defined as a species in 1980 by Farmer et al DNA DNA hybridization showed that E sakazakii was 53 54 related to species in two different genera , Enterobacter and Citrobacter However , diverse biogroups within E sakazakii were described and Farmer et al suggested these may represent different species and required further research for clarification The taxonomic relationship between E sakazakii strains has been studied using full length 16S rRNA gene sequencing , DNA DNA hybridization , multilocus sequence typing \( MLST \) , f AFLP , automated ribotyping This resulted in the classification of E sakazakii as a new genus , Cronobacter within the Enterobacteriaceae , initially comprising four named species in 2007 The taxonomy was expanded to five named species in 2008 , and more recently \( 2011 \) to seven named species Free full text The initial four named species in 2007 were Cronobacter sakazakii \( comprising two subspecies \) , C turicensis , C muytjensii and C dublinensis \( comprising three subspecies \) plus an unnamed species referred to as Cronobacter genomospecies I The taxonomy was revised in 2008 to include a fifth named species C malonaticus , which in 2007 had been regarded as a subspecies of C sakazakii In 2011 , Cronobacter genomospecies I was formally renamed Cronobacter universalis , and a seventh species was described called Cronobacter condimenti References External links An international meeting on Cronobacter Category Enterobacteria de Cronobacter sakazakii es Enterobacter sakazakii id Enterobacter sakazakii ja sv Enterobacter sakazakii
