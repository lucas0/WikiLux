produced is sold as raw milk while the remaining one third is refined into other dairy products such as milk , cheese and butter In Canada , dairy farming is subject to the system of supply management Under supply management , which also includes the egg and poultry sectors , farmers manage their production so that it coincides with forecasts of demand for their products over a predetermined period while taking into account certain imports that enter Canada , as well as some production which is shipped to export markets Imports of dairy , eggs , and poultry are controlled using tariff rate quotas , or TRQs These allow a predetermined quantity to be imported at preferential tariff rates \( generally duty free \) , while maintaining control over how much is imported The over quota tariffs are set at levels that should allow Canadian farmers to receive a price reflecting the cost to produce in the country While there has been some pushback regarding the supply management system , research indicates that the Canadian population generally have varied views with the current system Dairy Farmers of Canada \( 2017 \) Why supply management works for Canadians Retrieved from https www dairyfarmers ca what we do supply management why supply management works for canadians History The Canadian Dairy Farmers' Federation was founded in 1934 The group became Dairy Farmers of Canada in 1942 , and its mandate was to stabilize the dairy market and increase revenues for dairy farmers In the face of lobbying , government programs were instituted in the 1940s and 1950s to increase prices and limit imports 1958 saw the creation of the Agricultural Stabilization Board , though it was not limited to dairy In the 1950s and 1960s there was significant volatility in dairy prices dairy producers were seen as having too much bargaining power relative to dairy farmers , and the United Kingdom was poised to enter the European Common Market , resulting in the loss of Canada 's largest dairy export partner These challenges led to the creation of the Canadian Dairy Commission , whose mandate was to ensure the quality and supply of milk , that producers received a fair return on investment , and set prices based on production costs , market price , consumer 's ability to pay , and current economic conditions Supply management The government of Canada put in place a supply management system during the early 1970 's , as an effort to reduce the surplus in production that had become common in the 1950s and 1960s , and to ensure a fair return for farmers thumb Milk for sale in a supermarket in London , Ontario Supply management is a shared jurisdiction between the Federal and Provincial governments For example , on a Canada wide basis , there is the Canada wide Canadian Dairy Commission , composed mostly of dairy farmers , while in Ontario there is the Dairy Farmers of Ontario Other provinces also have similar local boards In 1983 , the National Milk Marketing Plan came into effect to control supply , setting guidelines for calculating Market Sharing Quota This agreement is between the federal and provincial powers The Milk Marketing Plan was created to replace the Comprehensive Milk Marketing Agreement , which was initially established in 1971 By 1983 , every province except Newfoundland had signed onto the Milk Marketing Agreement

management system Retrieved from https lop parl ca Content LOP ResearchPublications 2015 138 e pdf The basic idea behind supply management is to manage production so that supply is in balance with demand , and the farm gate price enables farmers to cover their costs of production , including a return on labour and capital Each farm owns a number of shares in the market \( quota \) , and is required to increase or decrease production according to consumer demand Because production is in sync with demand , overproduction is avoided this enables farmers to earn a predictable and stable revenue , directly from the market A supply management system for Canadian dairy products is beneficial to Canadian dairy farmers however , the consequence of such a system is artificially higher dairy prices in Canada which has shown to affect the consumption of dairy products in Canada Due to higher prices , individuals are consuming lower amounts of dairy products and instead consuming

Canada , the amount spent to protect the system and the tactics used , the electoral clout that dairy farmers have on elections , as well as the fact that the average dairy farmer have become significantly wealthier in term of net worth These groups also feel like that the system also be done away in order to increase food manufacturing , reduce food waste , tackling poverty and prevent future food shortages In addition , the Canadian dairy system makes Canadian dairy farmers unable to participate in the global dairy market potentially limiting their expansion if they could compete with artificially low international milk prices and should be done away with in light of Canada 's commitment to free trade Regulations Canadian dairy farmers have strict regulations outlined by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to ensure proper oversight of dairy production and to guarantee that strict standards of biosecurity are upheld These regulations provide clear guidelines for Canadian dairy farmers to adhere to in order for them to ensure biosecurity standards are maintained in the sectors of environmental protection , human health , animal health , and animal welfare In adhering

78 5 of GHG emissions created by the Canadian dairy farming industry Feed sources and greenhouse gas emissions The type of feed utilized by Canadian dairy farmers significantly affects the amount of GHG emissions as a result of dairy production Canadian dairy farmers commonly feed their cattle corn or barley silage as high nutrient food sources to increase milk production Although corn and barley are both efficient and economic sources of feed , these two feed sources are responsible for large amounts of greenhouse gas \( GHG \) emission in Canada While both of these types of feed contribute

organic farming is attributed to a significant degree of self sufficiency for all aspects of production Consequently , conventional farming is perceived as being highly advanced technologically , utilizing efficient fertilizers and automated processes throughout the farm , driving down costs associated with physical labour Conventional farming is , therefore , widely perceived as being the more modern and economically successful method of dairy farming in Canada Contrary to this belief , costs associated with organic farming are substantially lower than costs incurred by conventional farming Organic Canadian dairy farms have been shown to have a lower overall cost of production and are more self sufficient in terms of plant and animal nutrient recycling and restocking of livestock herds In contrast , the larger economic surplus enjoyed by conventional dairy farms in Canada is often offset by extra costs associated with importing fertilizers , seed , and replacement cattle ,
