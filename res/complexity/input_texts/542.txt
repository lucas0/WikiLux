members Most fans received this copy a day before the official release of the album The album in its entirety was leaked on the internet about two weeks prior to its release Crossing the Rubicon is the third official album released by The Sounds after Living in America and Dying to Say This to You \( there are some B Sides floating around the internet and talk of an album that was made before Living in America and Dying to Say This to You but this has yet to be confirmed \) When asked about the origin of the name of their album , Felix Rodriguez said , The album title is actually about where we ve been at for the last year When we made the decision to do everything ourselves , we felt we were crossing the point of no return \( the meaning of the phrase crossing the rubion \) By doing everything themselves , Felix is referring to the band 's firing of several people surrounding them who they felt were not contributing as much as they should have and were not as passionate about the project and propelling the band to the status they wished to obtain To promote the album , the band will begin a headlining tour in the fall of 2009 In a smart move , the band begain touring at the end of 2008 and are continuing to do so , in order to get their name out there They did a few headlining shows , many in small venues in the United States The turning point for the band is when they opened for No Doubt in California This increased their popularity considerably and likely will increase the sales of the new album The Sounds are considerably hard working individuals who have a set goal and to achieve that goal , they have played hundreds of shows every year since the release of their second album As any up and coming band will attest , touring is vital to your existence in the music industry If you do not continuously play , get your name out there , no one will know who you are You have to constantly remind everyone that you exist The Sounds have proven this point In reading or listening to the lyrics of many of The Sounds' songs , one might think most of them are about love but you will find that often times , they are not and involve hidden meanings and metaphors Their songs are built on an intelligent simplicity The first single , No One Sleeps When I m Awake , borrows its title from a quote by Ronnie Wood about his Rolling Stone band mate Keith Richards He actually said No one sleeps when he s awake , says Maja We liked it because it also describes us as a band and how we ve never given up on our dream Beatbox is the band s tribute to the simple joys of a drum machine I originally did a vocal that had this Donna Summer 70s vibe , but it didn t go with the sing song chorus , says Maja Felix wrote some fun lyrics and came up with the rap part It s a different direction for us , but I love how it came out For Midnight Sun , Maja uses her lower register to convey a mournfulness that , at face value , might seem at odds with the song s subject the city of Los Angeles We ve built up a large fan base there , says Jesper , referring in particular to the 4 , 000 people who helped the band sell out the Palladium the last time they were in town In Sweden , L A s considered this really glamorous place , but there s so much more to it than that We have a great time there , and it s become a second home to us It was while in Los Angeles that the band recorded the two tracks 4 Songs A Fight and My Lover with Jeff Turzo and Matt Mahaffey , who record and produce under the name Wired All Wrong Jeff and Matt think more like we do in that they like to experiment with different sounds , says Felix Jeff has a lot of cool electronic gear , Jesper adds He s got this keyboard from the 80s , and he also builds his own equipment 4 Songs A Fight is about just that the band was set to play four songs at a show and ended up in an alleged fight with another band Maja s taunting vocals are egged on by the bullying rhythm section , a musical skirmish that ends with the band joining each other in harmony My Lover opens with simple rhythmic synths and gurgling keyboards and breaks into a hypnotic dance beat I know you want to beat my lover is part of the main chorus , indicating a perhaps dark meaning It s a very dark story , says Maja , but I love the tension of mixing a danceable beat with really dark lyrics The meaning of the song is still rather unknown as it is not clear if she is talking in first person or if it 's a conversation The band also spent time in Los Angeles recording at the studio of their friend Tim Anderson of Ima Robot , who supported The Sounds in 2004 We ve toured with Tim , says Jesper , and he really knows what kind of music we want to make because he s seen us live He s old fashioned in the way that he wants music to deliver specific emotions That was really cool for us Together with Anderson , the band produced Dorchester Hotel , Underground , and The Only Ones The Only Ones sees the disintegration of society through war and violence as a parallel to the loss of an idyllic childhood relationship Opening with just piano and vocals , the spare arrangement lets the lyrics and the longing vocals tell the story for most of the song , slowly building to an ecstatic crescendo of guitar and drums That s a bit of a mature sound for us , says Felix We wanted the emotions to speak for themselves , so we gave the song more of a live sound Underground is both a yearning remembrance of things past as well as a full on tribute to the ecstatic joys of New Wave clich s the bopping beat , the angsty bass line , the candy coated chorus , and the perky keyboards remind us that the past is always available to us by way of our musical memories That s one of my favorites , says Felix It s meant to evoke feelings of what life was like back in the day The cheerful , chiming guitars of Dorchester Hotel mask a sick story of addiction It s a made up story about a guy that does things with his body that he s not proud of , but he can t stop doing it The middle of the song starts with an intimate breakdown , but builds to a wild frenzy before powering into the final uninhibited sing along chorus With just a few songs left to record , the band turned to British producer Mark Saunders at his studio in New York \( Saunders prior credits include The Cure , Depeche Mode , Tricky , and Neneh Cherry \) We knew he d be really good with the electronic sounds on Lost in Love and Home Is Where the Heart Is says Maja Lost in Love is perhaps the most vulnerable song on the album Sounding like a young girl adrift in her own emotional torture , an effect made to sound all the more tragic by sorrowful , undulating synths , Maja struggles to free herself from an immolating desire I love that long synthesizer part in the middle , says the singer It s gives the song so much more meaning It s like there s beauty in the midst of all of this pain The band finished writing Home Is Where the Heart Is on their last day in the studio I went into the booth to sing it , and when I was done , I said to Jesper , I can t believe that s me singing I got so emotional about my own contribution It s one of my all time favorites from all of our records The album s instrumental coda , the unlisted track Goodnight Freddy , was composed and recorded by Jesper late at night in the studio I used the kind of plastic keyboard that kids play with to record that song , says Jesper Fredrik was sleeping in the other room , and he woke up and said , That sounds really good I yelled back , Goodnight Freddy ! Fittingly , the band also produced the title track on their own , coming together to harmonize on lyrics that symbolize their mission to cross unchartered territory , bonded by their love for music and for each other , hoping to reach a place where there s no time , and no space , no mistakes to erase To complete the album and help them realize their creative vision , the band brought in revered British mixer Tim Palmer , known for mixing diverse and classic albums for artists like Robert Plant , The Cure and U2 , to tie the album all together The band s sense of wistfulness has only enhanced the depth of their vision and their determination to succeed With the perspective we ve gained from all of the soul searching we ve done over the last couple of years , it s no longer important to us where we came from , says Maja All that matters is where we re going The point of having done 500 shows is that it will enable us to do 500 more We ll be out there as long as our fans want to hear us play Track listing No One Sleeps When I'm Awake http tashed com 2009 05 the sounds crossing the rubicon 4 09 4 Songs A Fight 3 24 My Lover 4 25 Dorchester Hotel 4 08 Beatbox 4 02 Underground 3 47 Crossing The Rubicon 2 03 Midnight Sun 4 30 Lost In Love 5 05 The Only Ones 4 44 Home Is Where Your Heart Is 5 11 Goodnight Freddy 4 04 iTunes bonus track No One Sleeps When I'm Awake \( Arnioki Sessions \) 4 09 Charts Chart \( 2009 \) Peakposition Finnish Albums ChartSuomen virallinen lista 4 The Billboard 200Billboard com Artist Chart History The Sounds 64 Personnel Maja Ivarsson Vocals Felix Rodriguez Guitar Johan Bengtsson Bass Jesper Anderberg Keyboards , Piano , Guitar Fredrik Nilsson Drums References Category 2009 albums Category The Sounds albums Category New Wave albums Category New Line Records albums Category English language albums sv Crossing the Rubicon \( The Sounds \)
