The Hay Diet is a nutrition method developed by the New York physician William Howard Hay in the 1920s It claims to work by separating food into three groups alkaline , acidic , and neutral \( Hay 's use of these terms does not completely conform to the scientific use , i e , the pH of the foods \) Acid foods are not combined with the alkaline ones Acidic foods are protein rich , such as meat , fish , dairy , etc Alkaline foods are carbohydrate rich , such as rice , grains and potatoes It is also known as the food combining diet A similar theory , called nutripathy , was developed by Gary A Martin in the 1970s Rasso , Jack , Mystical Medical Alternativism , Committee for Skeptical Inquiry , Skeptical Inquirer , September October 1995 available online Others who have promulgated alkaline acid diets include Edgar Cayce , D C Jarvis , and Robert O Young History thumb Chart from How to Always Be Well , William Howard Hay In 1905 , Hay seems to have had an episode of acute heart failure following running for a train As a result he discovered that he had Bright 's disease \( hypertension with nephritis \) with a dilated heart , a condition with a poor prognosis at the time Hay started looking for ways to improve his condition He first turned to a vegetarian diet and restricted his eating to once a day in the evening Then he gave up coffee and a few months later he quit smoking tobacco After three months of the new regimen his weight had dropped from 225 lbs to 175 lbs and he noticed improvements in his health Motivated by this experience , Hay spent the following decade studying naturopathy , orthopathy and food combining in efforts to reduce as he termed it the vast quantities of acid waste that result from wrong selection and combination of the daily foods He claimed that fruits and vegetables produced alkaline 'end products' when they were metabolized , while processed and refined foods resulted in acidic 'end products' after digestion His theories went on to encompass food combining stating that incorrect combinations of foods would cause even alkaline foods to leave a less desirable acidic digestion end product Needes , Robin , Naturopathy for Self healing Nutrition , Life style , Herbs , Homoeopathy , Acid Alkaline Balance available online The Hay System promoted eating three meals per day with meal one being what the diet considers to be alkaline foods only , meal two composed of what the diet considers to be protein foods with salads , vegetables and fruit , and meal three composed of what the diet considers to be starchy foods with salads , vegetables and sweet fruit with an interval of 4 0 to 4 5 hours between each meal The Hay diet was popular in the 1930s and many restaurants offered 'Hay friendly' menus followers of his dietary advice , included Henry Ford and Man Ray Baldwin , Neil , Man Ray American Artist , p 170 available online Man Ray now wholehaartedly adopted Dr Hay 's taboos , as he had on earlier occasions In this period Hay was criticized in the Journal of the American Medical Society \( JAMA \) as a food faddist and separately for advocating that a patient with type 1 diabetes on the Hay diet should stop taking insulin In 1935 , Stewart Baxter showed that the pancreas secretes digestion enzymes simultaneously regardless of whether the food eaten is carbohydrates or protein , contrary to one of the central propositions of the diet Cardwell , Glenn , The Skeptic , Nutrition Food Combining , Vol 16 , No 2 available online Currently , the theory that carbohydrate and protein rich foods should be eaten separately is considered unfounded because it ignores the fact that carbohydrate rich foods contain significant amounts of protein Eating protein separately from carbohydrates also tends to cause the body to burn the protein as an energy source rather than to build muscle Nevertheless , despite continual criticism over lack of a scientific basis , the Hay diet and its variants , such as the Kensington diet and the Beverly Hills Diet , remain popular , with actors such as Elizabeth Hurley , Helen Mirren and Catherine Zeta Jones following food combining diets Studies The food combining diet has been the subject of one peer reviewed randomized clinical trial , which found no benefit from the diet in terms of weight loss See also Food combining Alkaline diet Fit for Life List of diets References Further reading Boyer , Josephine , and Katherine Cowdin \( 1934 \) Hay Dieting Menus and Receipts for All Occasions With a foreword by William Howard Hay New York , New York C Scribner 's sons Hay , William Howard \( 1933 \) Health Via Food Ed and rev by Rasmus Alsaker , with a special introduction by Oliver Cabana , Jr First printing , June , 1929 Tenth printing , February , 1933 East Aurora , New York , Sun Diet Health Foundation Hay , William Howard \( 1935 \) Weight Control New York Hay System Category Diets Category Fad diets
