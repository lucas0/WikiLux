stars , and wrote I report faithfully that I laughed frequently You may very well hate it , but at least you 've been informed Perhaps you could enjoy the material about other religions , and tune out when yours is being discussed That 's only human nature Robert W Butler of The Kansas City Star gave the film a rating of three stars , and commented The film is one sided , less a measured argument than a bunch of rants and barbed observations But it s also very funny , which trumps everything else Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a rating of A , and wrote The movie is funny as well , hell The Canadian Press said the movie delivers a laugh out loud attack on the most sacred of cows Christie Lemire , of the Associated Press , wrote If you 're an atheist or an agnostic , you 'll be completely on board and happy to tag along with Maher as he travels the globe asking people about their faith everywhere from Jerusalem to the Vatican to Amsterdam , where he finds not only the Cannabis Ministry but also a Muslim gay bar \( with two people in it \) John Anderson of Newsday wrote much that 's funny , insightful and thought provoking But it certainly does n't give the religious a lot of slack The documentary received some negative reviews , with Rick McGinnis of Metro concluding that , Maher is preaching to the choir with an undisguised dishonesty that only the true believers will forgive James Berardinelli wrote , If the subject of religion is as important to Maher as he claims during his end comments , then he should have followed those words with actions and made a movie that 's more than a sum of inauthentic interviews , ranting attacks , and obvious observations The choir may hum along with Maher but the rest of those watching this movie will be singing the blues Nick Schager of Slant Magazine called it an atheistic wannabe dissection of modern faith In a review for The New York Times , Stephen Holden notes that when Maher turns from evangelical Christianity to Judaism and Islam , its tone becomes uncertain and its rhythm choppy Holden , Stephen \( 2008 10 01 \) Believers , Skeptics and a Pool of Sitting Ducks , New York Times

disturbing Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter characterized the film as An often hilarious but relentlessly shallow attack on religious fundamentalism by humorist Bill Maher Louis Peitzman of the San Francisco Bay Guardian wrote that It does n't even matter that he goes out of his way to be offensive , as he 's consistently funny enough to pull it off Scott Indrisek wrote at Style com that Religulous earns many of its laughs from skillful editing , with Maher 's interviews jazzed up by video clips Ben Kenigsberg of Time Out New York gave the film a rating of three out of six stars , and
