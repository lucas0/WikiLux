of Hadith \( sayings of Muhammad \) , and a detailed grasp of Classical Arabic Her influence is widespread , and is not restricted only to women Notable views She considers taqlid in regards to Islamic jurisprudence to be permitted for those , who have no other choice but discourages the blind taqlid that shuns the verses of the Qur'an , the sunnah of the prophet , the sayings of the companions and the taqlid that prevents people from searching for evidence Is Taqleed the only option for the common person \? Dr Farhat Hashmi believes that , qaza \( Re offering of the intentionally missed prayer \) is of no significance , since it is not supported by any evidence from the Quran and Sunnah There is a difference of opinion amongst the Muslim Scholars over this issue where those scholars who say that intentionally missed prayers have to be re offered do so by analogy with the one who forgets or falls asleep and thus do not have any direct command or evidence During a sermon when asked by a woman , what a wife should do if her husband was unwilling to help her destitute parents , Hashmi promptly quoted An Nisa , 34 \( Chapter Al Nisa , verse 34 \) of the Quran , arguing that the wife should comply with her husband s wishes , no matter what , as he was her divinely appointed imam According to Hashmi , women can recite the Quran during their menstrual periods since she believes that there is no such evidence to prohibit them to do so , however Menustrating women should only touch the Quran indirectly using a clean cloth or gloves There is a difference of opinon amongst the Muslim scholars on this issue where majority of them believe that women are prohbited to do so Hashmi encourages her followers , mostly well to do Pakistani women , to interpret the Qur an for themselves , but her critics argue that Hashmi s talks center around personal and family development , rather than community service instead of using their knowledge to improve their social conditions Awakening Islam According to Hashmi , qurbani \( the sacrifice of a livestock animal during Eid al Adha \) is an optional thing for those , who cannot easily afford one comment All muslims agree with this See also List of Pakistanis References External links Category Pakistani academics Category Pakistani educators Category Pakistani educationists Category Pakistani scholars Category Pakistani people Category Muslim scholars Category Muslim scholars of Islam Category Pakistani Muslims Category Islam and women Category Year of birth missing \( living people \) Category Living people Category Controversies Category University of the Punjab alumni Category International Islamic University , Islamabad faculty
