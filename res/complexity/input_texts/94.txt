Diet recommendations are an important part of diabetes management The diets most often recommended stress the importance of the glycemic index Recommendations of carbohydrate intake vary from 40 to 65 High intake of dietary fiber , especially soluble fiber , but low in fat \( especially saturated fat \) is recommended \( In cases of hypoglycemia , they are advised to have food or drink that can raise blood glucose quickly , followed by a long acting carbohydrate \( such as rye bread \) to prevent risk of further hypoglycemia \) But others question the usefulness of the glycemic index and recommend high GI foods like potatoes and rice Exchange scheme In the 1950s , the American Diabetes Association , in conjunction with the U S Public Health Service , brought forth the exchange scheme This was a scheme that allowed people to swap foods of similar nutritional value \( e g carbohydrate \) for another , so , for example , if wishing to have more than normal carbohydrates for dessert , one could cut back on potatoes in one 's first course The exchange scheme was revised in 1976 , 1986 and 1995 \( Chalmers Peterson , 1999 , p85 \) Later developments However , not all diabetes dietitians today recommend the exchange scheme Instead , they are likely to recommend a typical healthy diet one high in fiber , with a variety of fruit and vegetables , and low in both sugar and fat , especially saturated fat A diet that is high in plant fibre was recommended by James Anderson \( Anderson Ward , 1979 cited in Murray Pizzorno , 1990 \) This may be understood as continuation of the work of Denis Burkitt and Hugh Trowell on dietary fibre , which in turn , may be understood as a continuation of the work of Price \( Murray Pizzorno , 1990 \) In 1976 , Nathan Pritikin opened a centre where patients were put on programme of diet and exercise \( the Pritikin Program \) This diet is high on carbohydrates and fibre , with fresh fruit , vegetables , and whole grains A study at UCLA in 2005 showed that it brought dramatic improvement to a group of diabetics and pre diabetics in only three weeks , so that about half no longer met the criteria for the disease Physical activity

, in 1983 , Dr Richard K Bernstein began treating diabetics and pre diabetics successfully with a very low carbohydrate diet , avoiding fruit , added sugar , and starch Both the Pritikin approach and the Bernstein approach prescribe exercise Carbohydrates The American Diabetes Association in 1994 recommended that 60 70 of caloric intake should be in the form of carbohydrates As mentioned above , this is controversial , with some researchers claiming that 40 or even less is better , while others claim benefits for a high fiber , 75 carbohydrate diet An article summarizing the view of the American Diabetes Association contains the statement Sucrose containing foods can be substituted for other carbohydrates in the meal plan or , if added to the meal plan , covered with insulin or other glucose lowering medications Care should be taken to avoid excess energy intake Sucrose does not increase glycemia more than the same number of calories taken as starch Although it is not recommended to use fructose as a sweetener , fruit should not be avoided because of its fructose content Benefits may be obtained by consumption of dietary fibre in conjunction with carbohydrate as Francis \( 1987 \) points out , evidence suggests that carbohydrate consumed with dietary fibre will have a less major impact on glycemic rise than the same amount of carbohydrate consumed alone What has not generally been included in diabetic diet recommendations is the variation in effect from different carbohydrates Despite a common belief that table sugar contributes to the development of diabetes , it has medium \( 55 69 \) glycemic index that actually produces lower blood glucose levels than the same amount of calories obtained from some other sources of carbohydrates The Canadian Diabetes Association recommended that table sugar be included as part of the diabetes diet http www sugar ca english healthprofessionals diabetes cfm 3 Timing of meals For people with diabetes , healthy eating is not simply a matter of what one eats , but also when one eats The question of how long before a meal one should inject insulin is asked in Sonsken , Fox and Judd \( 1998 \) The answer is that it depends upon the type of insulin one takes and whether it is long , medium or quick acting insulin If patients check their blood glucose at bedtime and find that it is low , it is advisable that they take some long acting carbohydrate before retiring to bed to prevent night time hypoglycemia Special diabetes products Recently , Diabetes UK have warned against purchase of products that are specially made for people with diabetes , on the grounds that They may be expensive , They may contain high levels of fat They may confer no special benefits to people who suffer from diabetes Alcohol and drugs Moderation is advised with regards to consuming alcohol and the use of some drugs Alcohol inhibits the glycogenesis in the liver and some drugs inhibit hunger symptoms This , together with impaired judgment , memory and concentration caused by some drugs can lead to hypoglycemia Specific diets G I Diet lowering the glycemic index of one 's diet can improve the control of diabetes This includes avoidance of such foods as potatoes cooked in certain ways , and white bread , and instead favoring multi grain and sourdough breads , legumes and whole grains foods that are converted more slowly to glucose in the bloodstream Low Carb Diet It has been suggested that the gradual removal of carbohydrates from the diet and replacement with fatty foods such as nuts , seeds , meats , fish , oils , eggs , avocadoes , olives , and vegetables may help reverse diabetes Fats would become the primary calorie source for the body , and complications due to insulin resistance would be minimized However , it 's vitally important that such a diet be low in saturated fats The American Diabetes Association explains saturated fat raises blood cholesterol High blood cholesterol is a risk factor for heart disease People with diabetes have more frequent heart disease High fiber diet It has been shown that a high fiber diet works better than the diet recommended by the American Diabetes Association in controlling diabetes , and may control blood sugar levels with the same efficacy as oral diabetes drugs Paleolithic diet The Paleolithic diet has been shown to improve glucose tolerance in diabetes type 2 , glucose intolerance Vegan diet A low fat vegan diet improves glycemic control similar to the ADA diet History There has been long history of dietary treatment of diabetes mellitus as Ramachandran Viswanathan \( 1998 \) note , dietary treatment of diabetes mellitus was used in Egypt as long ago as 3 , 500 B C , and was used in India by Sushruta and Charaka more than 2000 years ago In the eighteenth century , these authors note , John Rollo argued that calorie restriction in the diabetic diet could reduce glycosuria in diabetes However , more modern history of the diabetic diet may begin with Frederick Madison Allen , who , in the days before insulin was discovered , recommended that people with diabetes ate only a low calorie diet to prevent ketoacidosis from killing them This was an approach which did not actually cure diabetes , it merely extended life by a limited period The first use of insulin by Frederick Banting in 1922 changed things , and at last allowed patients more flexibility in their eating References External links Further reading Murray , M Pizzorno , J \( 1990 \) Encyclopaedia of Natural Medicine London Littlebrown and Company ISBN 1 85605 498
