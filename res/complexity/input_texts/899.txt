Tej P Singh \( born 1944 \) is an Indian biophysicist known for his work in the fields of Rational Structure based drug design , Protein Structure biology and X ray crystallography He has played an active role in the development of drug design in the fields of Antibacterial therapeutics , Tuberculosis , Inflammation , Cancer and Gastropathy He is a fellow of six academies , namely , the Third World Academy of Sciences , Indian National Science Academy , National Academy of Sciences Idian Academy of Sciences , Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and Biotech Research Society of India Education Tej obtained his Masters in Science from the University of Allahabad He started his research career in 1971 as a graduate student at the Indian Institute of Science , Bangalore He obtained his Ph D degree in the mid 70 's working on the crystal structure determinations and design of anti inflammatory analgesics for new drug discovery Professional career Soon after obtaining his Ph D degree , Tej worked for ayear \( 1977 \) as a lecturer at the University of Indore He then spent more than two years \( 1978 1980 \) as an Alexander von Humboldt Max Planck , post doctoral fellow in the German laboratory of Professor Robert Huber , who later received the Nobel Prize After his return to India he worked as a reader at Sardar Patel University \( 1980 83 \) and an Additional Professor \( 1984 85 \) in the Department of Biophysics at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi He was appointed Professor and Head of the Department in 1986 Contributions in Protein Structural Biology The three dimensional structures of various proteins including lactoperoxidase , peptidoglycan recognition protein and lactoferrin from several species , ribosome inactivating proteins , bifunctional inhibitor proteins from plant seeds and various serine proteases and their inhibitors have been determined by his group The elaborate structural studies of proteins from several important systems as potential drug targets such as phospholipase A2 , cyclooxygenase , lipoxygenase , endothelin receptor , endothelin converting enzyme , breast cancer regression proteins and matrix metanosomal proteins as well as their complexes with natural and designed synthetic ligands have been carried out He had developed the rules of peptide design with alpha , beta dehydro amino acids through extensive studies using syntheses , and X ray and NMR structure determinations These design rules are being exploited for making specific peptides to act as tight inhibitors of target enzymes and potent antagonists of target receptors for eventually leading to useful therapeutic agents He initiated a new programme on Clinical Proteomicsiat teh All India Institute of Medical Sciences n which it is intended to characterize all the proteins that are expressed during various patho physiological conditions The newly identified proteins will either be useful as biomarkers or they may be associated with the progression of diseases making them important targets for drug design Awards and honors Tej is a Fellow of the Third World Academy of Sciences , Indian National Science Academy , National Academy of Sciences Indian Academy of Sciences , Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and Biotech Research Society of India He has won the Goyal Prize for Life Sciences , Distinguished Biotechnology Research Professor \( DBT \) \( 2009 \) , GN Ramachandran Gold Medal for excellence in Science and Technology \( CSIR \) \( 2006 \) , Distinguished Biotechnologist \( DBT \) , 2006 , JC Bose Memorial Award \( 2005 \) , Alexander von Humboldt Fellow \( 1977 \) , Canadian development Agency Award \( 1999 \) External links http dst gov in whats new press release07 biotech award htm http www jbc org cgi reprint M208967200v1 pdf http articles timesofindia indiatimes com 2004 06 25 delhi 27169560 1 snake venom poisonous snakes joint pain http www bio medicine org medicine news Five New Anti Inflammatory Compounds Produced By Indian Scientists 6838 1 References Category Living people Category 1944 births Category Crystallographers Category Indian chemists Category Indian biophysicists Category Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category All India Institute of Medical Sciences faculty Category Fellows of the Indian National Science Academy Category Fellows of the Indian Academy of Sciences Category Fellows of The National Academy of Sciences , India Category Indian Institute of Science alumni
