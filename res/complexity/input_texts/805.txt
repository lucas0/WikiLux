DeviantArt and the Production of the Web Berkeley CA Retrieved September 28 , 2012 p 29 DeviantArt was originally launched on August 7 , 2000 , by Scott Jarkoff , Matt Stephens , Angelo Sotira and others , as part of a larger network of music related websites called the Dmusic Network The site flourished largely because of its unique offering and the contributions of its core member base and a team of volunteers after its launch , but was officially incorporated in 2001 about eight months after launch DeviantArt was loosely inspired by projects like Winamp facelift , customize org , deskmod com , screenphuck com , and skinz org , all application skin based websites Sotira entrusted all public aspects of the project to Scott Jarkoff as an engineer and visionary to launch the early program All three co founders shared backgrounds in the application skinning community , but it was Matt Stephens whose major contribution to DeviantArt was the suggestion to take the concept further than skinning and more toward an art community Many of the individuals involved with the initial development and promotion of DeviantArt still hold positions with the project , from administrators to volunteers serving as gallery directors and Message Network Administration Angelo Sotira currently serves as the chief executive officer of DeviantArt , Inc On November 14 , 2006 , DeviantArt gave its users the option to submit their works under Creative Commons licenses giving the artists the right to choose how their works can be used A Creative Commons license is one of several public copyright licenses that allow the distribution of copyrighted works On September 30 , 2007 , a film category was added to DeviantArt , allowing artists to upload videos An artist and other viewers can add

DeviantArt 's services entirely , citing US and Israeli sanctions and aftermath on February 19 , 2018 Syrian user Mythiril used a VPN to access the site and disclose the geoblocking in a journal , titled the Hypocrisy of Deviantart , that sparked a public outcry across DeviantArt and other sites DeviantArt eventually ended the geoblocking except for commercial features Copyright and licensing issues There is no review for potential copyright and Creative Commons licensing violations when a work is submitted to DeviantArt , so potential violations can remain unnoticed until reported to administrators using the mechanism available for such issues Some members of the community have been the victims of copyright infringement from vendors using artwork illegally on products and prints , as reported in 2007 The reporting system in which to counteract copyright infringement directly on the site has been subject to a plethora of criticism from members of the site , given that it may take weeks , or even a month before a filed complaint for copyright infringement is answered Contests for companies and academia Due to the nature of DeviantArt as an art community with worldwide reach , companies use DeviantArt to promote themselves and create more advertising through contests CoolClimate is a research network connected with the University of California , and they held a contest in 2012 to address the impact of climate change Worldwide submissions were received , and the winner was featured in The Huffington Post Various car companies have held contests Dodge ran a
