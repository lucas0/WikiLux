New Opportunities in Adult Education and How to Avoid Being Ripped Off by 'Christian' Degree Mills 4th ed The college has varied its policies over the years , but it has been criticized for awarding students degrees based on questionable standards such as life experience or ministry evaluation that lack academic rigour and merit The university is not accredited by any recognized accreditation associations of higher learning As of 2007 , it was recognized by the American Accrediting Association of Theological Institutions \( AAATI \) , which has no recognition from the United States Department of Education or any other government educational organization The AAATI is itself considered an accreditation mill , and provides approval to schools for a 100 charge In 2008 , it was accredited by Accrediting Commission International The ACI is again not recognized by the US Department of Education The St Petersburg Times reported , Alan Contreras , who heads Oregon 's Office of Degree Authorization , which closely tracks schools with questionable accreditation 'Anything accredited by ACI in Beebe , Ark , is either fake or substandard , as far as I know ' Tuition , requirements , and criticism thumb Close up profile view of Patriot Bible University taken on November 22 , 2006 Critics have charged that Patriot Bible University is a diploma mill as it has unreasonably low graduation requirements , lack of sufficient faculty or educational standards , and a suspicious tuition scheme , among other issues The college itself has claimed that it simply does not choose to be accredited by standard associations The school 's current policies allow students with previous college credits to attain bachelor 's degrees , master 's degrees and even Doctor of Ministry degrees in months , rather than years , for as little as 38 per month plus books The university offers a monthly fee , unlike most universities , which only charge per credit fees Patriot allows students to prepay for degrees \( such as , D Min fully pre paid , 1899 \) and for those who already have a degree they are required to complete only 12 courses for the Bachelor of Arts level The school 's catalog contains course descriptions but no listing of the school 's faculty or their credentials Patriot Bible University is divided into 3 schools College of Ministerial Studies , College of Christian Education , and Patriot School of the Bible The College of Ministerial Studies and College of Christian Education offer Christian Bible degrees at the undergraduate , and graduate degree levels Patriot School of the Bible offers Bible diplomas , certifications , ministry and leadership training , and continuing education Kent Hovind Much of the criticism of Patriot is leveled at the controversial creationist evangelist Kent Hovind , who received M A and Ph D degrees at Patriot in 1989 and 1991 respectively , both in Christian Education Hovind 's use of the title Doctor in particular has provoked interest and subsequently , scrutiny of his education credentials as well as his dissertation Doctoral dissertations from reputable institutions are published by the awarding institution and generally lodged with university libraries , as well as being made available to other scholars conducting research in similar areas However , Patriot will not supply copies of Hovind 's doctoral dissertation except with his permission Bartlet wrote that the copy she viewed is on file at the National Center for Science Education \( NCSE \) , but the organization cannot distribute it due to copyright restrictions The NCSE 's copy was received from Skip Evans who obtained Hovind 's dissertation from Patriot with Hovind 's permission in March 1999 Critics have described Hovind 's dissertation as incomplete , low academic quality , poor writing , poor spelling , and ungrammatical style The lack of quality was described , in part , by the fact that the pages are not numbered there is no title of sixteen or so chapters in the index only the first four are finished misspellings are rampant \( Immerged for emerged , epic for epoch , and tentable for testable are three examples \) and the single illustration was apparently cut out of a science book with scissors and fastened to the thesis with glue or tape Hovind 's dissertation was approved by one person , Wayne Knight , who was and remains president of Patriot Patriot has posted Hovind 's religious testimony on its website and posted a defense of him In 2010 , Patriot responded to Wikileaks' claim to have revealed Hovind 's dissertation Patriot wrote the posting was not the finished product , but because they do not retain ownership to student thesis or dissertations , as is commonly practiced by many schools , they cannot release student work to the public See also Diploma mill List of unaccredited institutions of higher learning List of unrecognized accreditation associations of higher learning
