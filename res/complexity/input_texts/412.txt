Scientific dissent is dissent from scientific consensus Disagreements can be useful for finding problems in underlying assumptions , methodologies , and reasoning , as well as for generating and testing new ways of tackling the unknown de Melo Mart n , I and Intemann , K \( 2013 \) Scientific dissent and public policy EMBO Reports , 14 \( 3 \) 231 235 In modern times , with the increased role of science on the society and the politicization of science , a new aspect gained prominence effects of scientific dissent on public policies Scientific dissent is distinct from denialism , which is a deliberate rejection of scientific consensus usually for commercial or ideological reasons Scientific dissent as norm of scientific inquiry Miriam Solomon in her book Social Empiricism argues that scientific dissent is the normal state of scientific inquiry , rather than a conflict situation that needs resolution She argues that disagreements of individual scientists about the proper direction of research are not cause for concern , because scientific rationality must be assessed at the level of the scientific community As long as all theories being pursued yield some unique empirical successes , Solomon argues that their pursuit is worthwhile and even consistent with the common view that science aims at truth In Solomon 's view , competing scientific theories can even be inconsistent with one another while each containing some degree of truth Empirical evidence may not be sufficient to distinguish between competing theories , and successful theories often have core assumptions that are incorrect Historical scientific dissent A number of famous scientists have been sceptical of what were , or came to be , mainstream scientific positions For example , Ernst Mach famously declared in 1897 I do n't believe that atoms exist ! John T Blackmore , Ernst Mach His Work , Life , and Influence , University of California Press , 1972 , p 206 Wilhelm Ostwald expressed a similar scepticism about atoms , but changed his mind in 1908 Mary Jo Nye , Molecular Reality A perspective on the Scientific Work of Jean Perrin , Macdonald , 1972 , p 151 In the early 20th century , peptic ulcers were believed to be caused by stress and dietary factors The physicians Robin Warren and Barry Marshall showed in 1982 that the bacterium Helicobacter pylori was responsible , but the medical community was slow to make appropriate changes in ulcer treatment Suppressed dissent Scientific debate is a healthy and necessary part of science , but scientific debate may collide with power dynamics within the academic world Delborne , J A \( 2016 \) Suppression and Dissent in Science In Tracey Ann Bretag \( Ed \) Handbook of Academic Integrity , 64 943 956 Springer Suppression of legitimate scientific debate can be considered as a breach of academic integrity Examples of suppression include journal editors rejecting a paper for political reasons prior to peer review , refusing access to data for research which might draw negative conclusions about the safety of some commercial product , and putting pressure on a university to fire a dissenting researcher False scientific dissent In modern times proponents of science denialism , pseudoscience , and conspiracy theories often try to disguise their viewpoints as scientific dissent to take an advantage of the benefit of doubt Such cases are typically recognized by lack of crucial elements of scientific approach insufficient evidence base , lack of rigor and control , etc Keeping Modern Myths And Conspiracy Theories At Bay , April 7 , 2014 , Asian Scientist Magazine Lack of discussion of claims coming from fringe science may be presented as suppression by mainstream science This was described as manufacturing dissent and discussed in the context of neo creationism Matthew J Brauer , Daniel R Brumbaugh , Biology Remystified The Scientific Claims of the New Creationists , in Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics Philosophical , Theological , and Scientific Perspectives , MIT Press , 2001 , , pp 322 , 323 David Harker in the introduction to his book Creating Scientific Controversies , summarizes the history how tobacco industry worked towards manufacturing a controversy regarding the health effects of tobacco David Harker , Creating Scientific Controversies Uncertainty and Bias in Science and Society , , Cambridge University Press , 2015 In what is sometimes known as the Galileo gambit , pseudoscientists will sometimes compare themselves to Galileo , arguing that opposition from established scientists is actually a point in favour of their ideas Daniel T Willingham , When Can You Trust the Experts \?
