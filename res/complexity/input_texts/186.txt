is a form of alternative medicine developed in 1922 by Japanese Buddhist Mikao Usui Since originating in Japan , Reiki has been adapted into varying cultural traditions across the world Reiki practitioners use a technique they call palm healing or hands on healing by which a universal energy is allegedly transferred through the palms of the practitioner to a patient in order to encourage healing Reiki is considered pseudoscience It is based on qi \( chi \) , which practitioners say is a universal life force , although there is no empirical evidence that such a life force exists Reiki Fraudulent Misrepresentation Science Based Medicine Reiki Fraudulent Misrepresentation Science Based Medicine , accessdate May 28 , 2016 Clinical research has not shown Reiki to be effective as a medical treatment for any medical condition The American Cancer Society , Cancer Research UK , and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health state that Reiki should not be a replacement for conventional treatment of diseases such as cancer Etymology thumb upright Mikao Usui \( 1865 1926 \) thumb upright Chujiro Hayashi \( 1880 1940 \) According to the OED , the English alternative medicine word reiki or Reiki is etymologically from Japanese reiki \( \) mysterious atmosphere , miraculous sign \( first recorded in 1001 \) , combining rei soul , spirit and ki vital energy the Sino Japanese reading of Chinese l ngq \( \) numinous atmosphere Sino Japanese readings were historically borrowed from Middle Chinese pronunciations , reconstructed by Baxter Sagart as lengkhj \( \) The earliest recorded English usage dates to 1975 The OED cites The San Mateo Times , 2 May 1975 , 32 1 , announcing Hawayo Takata 's lecture A Reiki Master 's Prediction and Participation in his Own Transition The Japanese reiki is commonly written as in katakana syllabary or as in shinjitai new character form kanji It compounds the words rei \( spirit , miraculous , divine \) and ki \( qi gas , vital energy , breath of life , consciousness \) Ki is additionally defined as spirits one 's feelings , mood , frame of mind temperament , temper , disposition , one 's nature , character mind to do something , intention , will care , attention , precaution Some reiki translation equivalents from Japanese English dictionaries are feeling of mystery , an atmosphere \( feeling \) of mystery , and an ethereal atmosphere \( that prevails in the sacred precincts of a shrine \) \( feel , sense \) a spiritual \( divine \) presence Besides the usual Sino Japanese pronunciation reiki , these kanji have an alternate Japanese reading , namely ry ge , meaning demon ghost \( especially in spirit possession \) Both dictionaries define ry ge as a mononoke , meaning ghost demon evil spirit that possesses people Chinese l ngq was first recorded in the \( ca 320 BCE \) Neiye Inward Training section of the Guanzi , describing early Daoist meditation techniques That mysterious vital energy within the mind One moment it arrives , the next it departs So fine , there is nothing within it so vast , there is nothing outside it We lose it because of the harm caused by mental agitation Compare translating as The magical qi within the heart Modern Standard Chinese l ngq is translated by Chinese English dictionaries as \( of beautiful mountains \) spiritual influence or atmosphere 1 intelligence power of understanding 2 supernatural power or force in fairy tales miraculous power or force and 1 spiritual influence \( of mountains etc \) 2 ingeniousness cleverness Origins According to the inscription on his memorial stone , Usui taught his system of Reiki to over 2000 people during his lifetime Inscription on Usui 's memorial While teaching Reiki in Fukuyama \( , Fukuyama shi \) , Usui suffered a stroke and died on 9 March 1926 Research , critical evaluation , and controversy Basis and effectiveness The existence of the proposed mechanism for Reiki qi or life force energy has not been established Most research on Reiki is poorly designed and prone to bias There is no reliable empirical evidence that Reiki is helpful for treating any medical condition , although some physicians have said it might help promote general wellbeing In 2011 , William T Jarvis of The National Council Against Health Fraud stated that there is no evidence that clinical Reiki 's effects are due to anything other than suggestion or the placebo effect Reiki 's teachings and adherents claim that qi is physiological and can be manipulated to treat a disease or condition The existence of qi has not been established by medical research Therefore , Reiki is a pseudoscientific theory based on metaphysical concepts Scholarly evaluation Reiki is used as an illustrative example of pseudoscience in scholarly texts and academic journal articles Emily Rosa became the youngest person to publish in the medical literature at 11 years old when her school science project was published by the Journal of the American Medical Association demonstrating that reiki pracitioners could not detect the alleged life force under experiemental conditions Rhonda McClenton states , The reality is that Reiki , under the auspices of pseudo science , has begun the process of becoming institutionalized in settings where people are already very vulnerable In criticizing the State University of New York for offering a continuing education course on Reiki , Lilienfeld et al \( in Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology \) state , Reiki postulates the existence of a universal energy unknown to science and thus far undetectable surrounding the human body , which practitioners can learn to manipulate using their hands Ferraresi et al state , In spite of its Reiki diffusion , the baseline mechanism of action has not been demonstrated Wendy Reiboldt states about Reiki , Neither the forces involved nor the alleged therapeutic benefits have been demonstrated by scientific testing Several authors have pointed to the vitalistic energy which Reiki is claimed to treat Larry Sarner states \( in The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience \) , Ironically , the only thing that distinguishes Reiki from Therapeutic Touch is that it involves actual touch Massimo Pigliucci and Maarten Boudry state \( in Philosophy of Pseudoscience \) that the International Center for Reiki Training mimic s the institutional aspects of science seeking legitimacy but holds no more promise than an alchemy society An evidence based guideline published by the American Academy of Neurology , the American Association of Neuromuscular Electrodiagnostic Medicine , and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation states , Reiki therapy should probably not be considered for the treatment of PDN painful diabetic neuropathy Susan Palmer lists Reiki as among the pseudoscientific healing methods used by cults in France to attract members Issues in the literature One systematic review of 9 randomized clinical trials conducted by Lee , Pittler , and Ernst \( 2008 \) found several issues in the literature on Reiki First , several of these studies are actually funded by the US National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Second , depending on the tools used to measure depression and anxiety , the results varied and didn t appear to have much reliability or validity Furthermore , the scientific community has had issues in replicating the findings of studies that support Reiki The authors of the review also found issues in reporting methodology in some of the literature , in that often there were parts left out completely or not clearly described Frequently in these studies , sample sizes are not calculated and adequate allocation and conceal procedures were also not followed In their review , Lee , Pittler , and Ernst \( 2008 \) found that studies without double blind procedures tended to exaggerate treatment effects as well Additionally , there was no control for differences in experience of the Reiki administers and they found that even the same healer could produce different outcomes in different studies None of the studies in the review provided rationale for the treatment duration in such that there is a need for an optimal dosage of Reiki to be established for further research Another questionable issue with the Reiki research included in this systematic review was that no study reported any adverse effects It is clear that this area of research requires further studies to be conducted that follow proper scientific method , especially since the main theory on which the therapy is based has never been scientifically proven Safety Safety concerns for Reiki sessions are very low and are akin to those of many CAM practices Some physicians and health care providers however believe that patients may unadvisedly substitute proven treatments for life threatening conditions with unproven alternative modalities including Reiki , thus endangering their health Catholic Church concerns In March 2009 , the Committee on Doctrine of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops issued the document Guidelines for Evaluating Reiki as an Alternative Therapy , in which they declared that the practice of reiki was superstition , being neither truly faith healing nor science based medicine The guideline concluded that since Reiki therapy is not compatible with either Christian teaching or scientific evidence , it would be inappropriate for Catholic institutions , such as Catholic health care facilities and retreat centers , or persons representing the Church , such as Catholic chaplains , to promote or to provide support for Reiki therapy Since this announcement , some Catholic lay people have continued to practice reiki , but it has been removed from many Catholic hospitals and other institutions See also Energy medicine Glossary of alternative
