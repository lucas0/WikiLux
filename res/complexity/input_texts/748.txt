2011 Retrieved 15 September 2011 The Gloucestershire Old Spots \( also Gloucester , Gloucester Old Spot , Gloucestershire Old Spot Breeds of Livestock Gloucestershire Old Spots Swine or simply Old Spots Oldspots com \) is an English breed of pig which is predominantly white with black spots It is named after the county of Gloucestershire The Gloucestershire Old Spots pig is known for its docility , intelligence , and prolificity Boars reach a mature weight of 600 lb \( 272 kg \) and sows 500 lb \( 227 kg \) The pigs are white with clearly defined black \( not blue \) spots There must be at least one spot on the body to be accepted in the registry The breed 's maternal skills enable it to raise large litters of piglets on pasture Its disposition and self sufficiency should make it attractive for farmers raising pasture pigs and those who want to add pigs to diversified operations History The Gloucestershire Old Spots \( GOS \) Breed Society was formed in 1913 The originators of that society called the breed 'Old' Spots because the pig had been known for as long as anyone could remember The first pedigree records of pigs began in 1885 , much later than it did for cattle , sheep and horses because the pig was a peasant 's animal , a scavenger and was never highly regarded No other pedigree spotted breed was recorded before 1913 , so today 's GOS is recognised as the oldest such breed in the world From the British Pig Association Although if old paintings are to be trusted , there have been spotted pigs around for two or three centuries , the Gloucestershire Old Spots has only had pedigree status since the early 20th century Origins and development Besides its correct title and variations such as Gloster Spot or just Old Spot , the breed is also known as the Orchard Pig RBST Watchlist and The Cottager 's Pig Despite these humble origins , both The Prince of Wales and The Princess Royal keep GOS pigs on their respective Gloucestershire estates One other notable contributor is the Lincolnshire Curly Coat , a pig that has since gone extinct The Old Spots is also genetically and characteristically similar to the extinct Cumberland pig and is being used in its attempted recreation in the UK These breeds were regarded as thrifty and excellent foragers , supplementing their feed with roots and vegetation Additionally , the GOS gene pool has contributed to the American Spot and the Chester White Additional commonalities among these breeds include excellent maternal instincts and even temperament , as Old Spots tend to be very calm , good natured animals , another trait that makes them desirable to homesteaders and small farmers The females tend to be very devoted mothers , while the males seldom pose a threat to piglets thumb left A GOS sow and a GOS piglet meet a Kangal dog The Old Spots was once a very popular breed of pig With the advent of intensive farming , certain lean , pale , high yield breeds were chosen to suit the factory conditions and needs of mass production Many old breeds of pig died out , or were greatly diminished , in this time However , owing to consumer pressure in the United Kingdom , and changes to the law , both attributable to an increasing awareness of , and concern about , farming conditions , pigs have been increasingly reared outdoors there In addition , more consumers are looking for quality meat , as opposed to cheap , bland meat product In these conditions , old breeds well suited to living outdoors , such as the Old Spots , have increasingly been chosen by farmers looking to add value to their products Endangered breed GOS is on the Critical List by The Livestock Conservancy , The Livestock Conservancy Conservation Priority List meaning there are fewer than 200 annual registrations in the United States and estimated fewer than 2000 global population In the UK the Old Spots is listed as Category 5 , Minority by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust as there are fewer than 1000 registered
