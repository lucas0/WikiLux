The Balto Slavic language group consists of the Baltic and Slavic languages , belonging to the Indo European family of languages Baltic and Slavic languages share several linguistic traits not found in any other Indo European branch , which points to the period of common development However , there is an ongoing debate on the nature of that relationship Some claim they were genetically related , and others explain similarities by prolonged language contact A hypothetical Proto Balto Slavic language is also reconstructable , descending from Proto Indo European by means of well defined sound laws , and out of which modern Slavic and Baltic languages descended One particularly innovative dialect separated from the Balto Slavic dialect continuum and became ancestral to Proto Slavic language , out of which all other Slavic languages descended Historical dispute The nature of the relationship of the Balto Slavic languages has been the subject of much discussion from the very beginning of historical Indo European linguistics as a scientific discipline Even though the similarities between the two groups are often obvious , some are more intent on explaining them not in terms of a genetic relationship , but by language contact and dialectal closeness in the Proto Indo European period thumb right 400px Various schematic sketches of possible alternative Balto Slavic language relationships Van Wijk , 1923 Baltic and Slavic share more close phonological , lexical , morphosyntactic and accentological similarities than do any other language groups within the Indo European language family The notable early Indo Europeanist August Schleicher \( 1861 \) proposed a simple solution From Proto Indo European descended Proto Balto Slavic , out of which Proto Baltic and Proto Slavic emerged The Latvian linguist J nis Endzel ns thought , however , that any similarities among Baltic and Slavic languages were a result of an intensive language contact , i e , that they were not genetically related and that there was no common Proto Balto Slavic language Antoine Meillet \( 1905 , 1908 , 1922 , 1925 , 1934 \) , the distinguished French Indo Europeanist , in reaction to a second simplified theory of Schleicher 's , propounded a view according to which all similarities of Baltic and Slavic occurred accidentally , by independent parallel development , and that there was no Proto Balto Slavic language In turn , the Polish linguist Rozwadowski suggests that the similarities among Baltic and Slavic languages are a result of not only genetic relationship , but also of later language contact Thomas Olander corroborates the claim of genetic relationship in his research in the field of comparative Balto Slavic accentology Even though some linguists still do not accept today the genetic relationship , prevalent scholarly opinion is that there is very little doubt that Baltic and Slavic languages experienced a period of common development Beekes \( 1995 22 \) , for example , states expressly that t he Baltic and Slavic languages were originally one language and so form one group Gray and Atkinson 's \( 2003 \) application of language tree divergence analysis supports a genetic relationship between the Baltic and Slavic languages and dating the split of the family to about 1400 BCE That this was found using a very different methodology than other studies lends some credence to the links between the two Modern interpretation Traditionally the Balto Slavic languages are divided into Baltic and Slavic branches However , another division was proposed in the 1960s by Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov that the Balto Slavic proto language split from the start into West Baltic , East Baltic and Proto Slavic Thus Ivanov and Toporov were the first to question not only Balto Slavic unity , but also Baltic unity In their framework , Proto Slavic is a peripheral and innovative Balto Slavic dialect which suddenly expanded , due to a conjunction of historical circumstances , and effectively erased all the other Balto Slavic dialects , except in the marginal areas where Lithuanian , Latvian and Old Prussian developed Onomastic evidence shows that Baltic languages were once spoken in much wider territory than the one they cover today , all the way to Moscow , and were later replaced by Slavic The Ivanov Toporov model is supported by the newest research into Old Prussian as the only well documented representative of the West Baltic branch It is also supported by archaeological evidence and other historical indications The West and East Balts would have been separated from the Slavs by the Goths Before the split there was some kind of dialect continuum , on whose outskirts existed an innovative dialect that was ancestral to Proto Slavic This model also is supported by glottochronologic studies by V V Kromer thumb left 260px Area of Balto Slavic dialectic continuum \( purple \) with proposed material cultures correlating to speakers Balto Slavic in Bronze Age \( white \) Red dots archaic Slavic hydronyms The sudden expansion of Proto Slavic in the sixth and the seventh century \( around AD 600 , uniform Proto Slavic with no detectable dialectal differentiation was spoken from Thessaloniki in Greece to Novgorod in Russia \) is according to some connected to the hypothesis that Proto Slavic was in fact a koin of the Avar state , i e the language of the administration and military rule of the Avar khaganate in Eastern Europe cf with references It is well known from historical sources that Slavs and Avars jointly attacked the Byzantine Empire and laid siege to Constantinople Later historical sources , such as De Administrando Imperio by Constantine Porphyrogenitus , often mix Avars and Slavs , after a few centuries making no clear distinction between them According to that interpretation , Avars were a thin layer of military aristocracy in that state alliance , while the Slavs were a military caste warriors \( i e not a nation or ethnicity in the proper sense of that word \) Their language at first possibly only one local speech once koin ized , became a lingua franca of the Avar state This might explain how Proto Slavic spread to the Balkans and the areas of the Danubian basin , Slavic languages were spoken till the year 800 all the way to line Trieste Hamburg Later they were pushed back to the east and would also explain why the Avars were assimilated so fast , leaving practically no linguistic traces , and that Proto Slavic was so unusually uniform However , such a theory fails to explain how Slavic spread to Eastern Europe , an area which had no historical links with the Avar Khanate It is possible that the expansion of the Avar khanate during the second half of the eighth century coincided with the spread of Slavic into the neighbouring areas of Bohemia , Moravia and southern Poland \( but \) could hardly explain the spread of Slavic into Poland , Ukraine , Belarus and Russia , all regions that produced so far almost no archaeological evidence of Avar influence That sudden expansion of Proto Slavic erased most of the idioms of the Balto Slavic dialect continuum , which left us today with only three branches Eastern Baltic , Western Baltic and Slavic This secession of the Balto Slavic dialect ancestral to Proto Slavic is estimated on archaeological and glottochronological criteria to have occurred sometime in the period 1500 1000 BCE cf with references Classical glottochronology conducted by Czech Slavist M ejka in 1974 dates the Balto Slavic split to 910 340 BCE , Sergei Starostin in 1994 dates it to 1210 BCE , and recalibrated glottochronology conducted by Novotn Bla ek dates it to 1400 1340 BCE This agrees well with Trziniec Komarov culture , localized from Silesia to Central Ukraine and dated to the period 1500 1200 BCE Balto Slavic isoglosses The close relationship of the Baltic and Slavic languages is indicated by a series of exclusive isoglosses representing innovations not shared with any other IE branch \( especially in their phonology \) and by the fact that one can establish the relative chronology of those innovations , which is the most important criterion for establishing genetic relationship in historical linguistics The most important of these isoglosses are Winter 's law \( lengthening of vowels before PIE voiced consonants , probably only in a closed syllable \) identical reflexes of PIE syllabic sonorants Hirt 's law \( retraction of PIE accent to the preceding syllable closed by a laryngeal \) rise of the Balto Slavic acute before PIE laryngeals in a closed syllable replacement of PIE genitive singular of thematic nouns with ablative ending for instrumental plural of miHs e g Lith s num s , OCS syn mi 'with sons' formation of past tense with the ending \( a type of Lithuanian preterite d v 'he gave' , OCS imperfect b 'he was' \) generalization of the PIE neuter to stem to the nominative singular of masculine and feminine demonstratives instead of PIE so , i e PIE demonstrative \( this , that \) became PBSl tos , ta , tod formation of so called definite adjectives with a construction that includes adjective and a relative pronoun , e g Lith ger sis 'the good' as opposed to g ras 'good' , OCS dobr j 'the good' as opposed to dobr 'good' usage of genitive to state the object of a negated verb , e g Russ knigi \( ja \) ne ital , Lith knygos neskai iau 'I have n't' read the book' Common Balto Slavic innovations include several other prominent , but non exclusive isoglosses , such as the Satemization , Ruki , change of PIE o to PBSl a \( shared with Germanic , Indo Iranian and Anatolian branch \) and the loss of labialization in PIE labiovelars \( shared with Indo Iranian , Armenian and Tocharian \) A number of these , however , fit only in the relative chronology of other otherwise exclusive Balto Slavic isoglosses , which makes them specific Balto Slavic innovation Baltic and Slavic languages also show some amount of correspondence in vocabulary about 100 words are shared by Baltic and Slavic languages , either being a common innovation \( i e not of PIE origin \) or sharing the same semantic development from PIE root For example PBSl 'tilia' Lith l epa , Old Pr l pa , Latv li pa PSl l jp Common Slavic lipa \( OCS lipa , Russ lipa , Pol lipa \) PBSl 'hand' Lith rank , Old Pr r nkan \( A sg \) , Latv r oka PSl r nk Common Slavic \( OCS r ka , Russ ruk , Pol r ka \) PBSl 'head' Lith galv , Old Pr galwo , Latv galva PSl Common Slavic golv \( OCS glava , Russ golov , Pol g owa \) Among Balto Slavic archaisms notable is the retention of free PIE accent \( with many innovations \) On the other hand , there are very few exclusive isoglosses that connect Baltic languages only , and that leave Slavic languages aside Many of these isoglosses are trivial from a phonological point of view \( e g transition PIE tl Baltic kl \) , and most importantly , they do not show any kind of relative chronology Proto Balto Slavic language Proto Balto Slavic is a reconstructed proto language descending from Proto Indo European and out of which all later Baltic and
