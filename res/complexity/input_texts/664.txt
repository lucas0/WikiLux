, which occurred in broad daylight on Palm Sunday in 1937 The museum is housed inside the building where the event itself occurred , with one of its sections devoted to the Nationalist leader , Pedro Albizu Campos It also documents the blacklisting of Puerto Rican Nationalists performed by the United States , as well as hosting a considerable number of photos from the Nationalist era The museum is listed in the U S National Register of Historic Places in as Casa de la Masacre \( the Massacre House \) Background After the U S invasion of Puerto Rico in 1898 , the island 's political status within the U S became a subject of ardent conversation within Puerto Rican political circles A number of political parties sprung up as a result , with platforms based on their desired relationship to the U S The three basic party options were independence , statehood , and commonwealth The independence movement came to be symbolized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Winship 's persecution In the early 1930s , concurrent with the growing sentiment for Nationalism and independence in Puerto Rico , U S president Franklin D Roosevelt assigned a new governor for the island a former U S Army General named Blanton Winship General Winship recruited a U S military intelligence officer \( and scion of the Riggs National Bank \) named E Francis Riggs as his Chief of Police and governed for five years \( 1934 1939 \) During this time he engaged in an open struggle against the Nationalist Party and a direct persecution of its leadership Consistent with this open and intense political hostility , in October 1935 the State Police in the town of Rio Piedras murdered four Nationalist party members at the University of Puerto Rico in Rio Piedras , a neighboring town next to San Juan This was known as the Rio Piedras Massacre According to Jose E Ayoroa Santaliz in his work Museo Casa de la Masacre de Ponce En conmemoracion del Primer Cincuentenario de la Masacre de Ponce \( Ponce Massacre Museum March 2011 \) , page 2 , the Insular Ponce assassinated the four men in a pre meditated fashion and under the direction of the U S appointed Puerto Rico police chief the American colonel Francis Riggs The Nationalists responded by killing the State Chief of Police , Colonel Francis Riggs , on February 23 , 1936 The two young Nationalists responsible were captured and executed at the police barracks in San Juan without a trial , with no law enforcement officer ever being brought to trial for their executions Riggs' death provoked General Winship 's outrage He ordered police raids on every Nationalist Party office in the entire island , with the express purpose of finding evidence that would incriminate the party members in the assassination of Police Chief Riggs however , no evidence was ever found Despite the absence of any evidence , Winship 's government brought charges of sedition against Albizu Campos and the other party leaders Albizu Campos and the others were found not guilty by a jury consisting mostly of native Puerto Ricans However , General Winship arranged for a retrial to take place , this time with a 10 2 majority of North Americans on the jury Conviction was handily achieved , sentencing Albizu to ten years and the others to six years in the Atlanta federal penitentiary The elimination of the party 's leadership , however , stopped neither the Nationalist militancy nor Winship 's repression , a situation that resulted in the violent event that took place in Ponce in 1937 The parade left thumb 350px Photojournalist 's picture of the actual massacre event , on Marina and Aurora streets , with Casa de la Masacre in the background The Ponce Committee of the Nationalist Party had its headquarters at 32 Marina Street This was a corner property that bordered Aurora Street , and had been used as the committee 's meeting hall for over 10 years In 1937 , the local committee made plans for the annual celebration of the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico , which had taken place on March 22 , 1873 The date chosen for the 64th anniversary commemoration of the abolition of slavery was March 21 , 1937 The Nationalists had received a permit for the parade , which was to take place on Palm Sunday , from Ponce Mayor Jos Tormos Diego 's office But at the eleventh hour , Governor Winship instructed the new Insular Police Chief , Colonel Enrique de Orbeta , to contact Mayor Tormos and have him cancel the parade permit He also ordered Orbeta to increase the police force in the southern city , and to stop , by any means necessary , any demonstration conducted by the Nationalists in Ponce The massacre right thumb 250px Photo showing the machine gun bullet ridden Casa de la Masacre building , with relatives of Nationalists killed in the Ponce massacre The permit was revoked the very same morning of the activity , but the Party refused to cancel the parade and instructed its participants to form as planned in front of their club house and move on with the activity The group of participants consisted of the male members of the Cadets of the Republic , the female Daughters of the Republic group , and a small music band These together with their families , friends , and local bystanders started to assemble around the club house in preparation for the midday parade Simultaneous with this , some 150 well armed Insular Police officers positioned themselves strategically so as to encircle the demonstrators Tom s L pez de Victoria , Captain of the Ponce cadets was in charge of the cadets in the parade Moments before the march began , police Captain Soldevilla walked up and ordered L pez de Victoria to keep the cadets from marching L pez de Victoria ordered the cadet band to play La Borinque a , \( the Puerto Rican national anthem \) , and told his Cadets to start their march It is believed that a shot was fired by the police to instigate an incident , and to provide an alibi for opening fire on the unarmed Palm Sunday marchers The police unleashed a fusillade of gunfire into the defenseless crowd This included fifteen to twenty policemen shooting Thompson 45 machine guns \( Tommy Guns \) for a full ten minutes , wounding almost 200 people and immediately killing fourteen Five more died as a result of their wounds during the next few days The investigation The violent incident in Ponce shook the entire population of the Island despite their political differences The American Civil Liberties Union \( ACLU \) came to Puerto Rico and formed a commission consisting of well respected citizens to investigate the incident , with Dr Arthur Garfield Hays , President of the ACLU , as the Commission 's president After months of investigation that ACLU commission determined that Governor Winship was directly responsible for the incident that the Nationalists were exercising their basic right of freedom of speech and association and that the killing of defenseless party members and by standers had to be recognized as a massacre The afternoon of March 21 , 1937 , became one of the saddest and the most violent day in the Puerto Rican political struggle for independence
