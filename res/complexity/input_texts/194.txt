a governor in chief \( comparable in rank to a Governor general \) , an office vested in the governor of Sierra Leone \( at Freetown \) The various colonies were established to aid the efforts of the Royal Navy 's West Africa Squadron wresting of control from various polities' resources , cultures and highly profitable exports Coaling stations and depots were built in the coastal villages and because many people lost their lands , businesses and livelihoods , low wage jobs that were created as a result of resource exploitation were all that was left for many from the local population
