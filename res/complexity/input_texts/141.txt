Zealand community based symphony orchestra formed in 1975 by founding musical director Gary Daverne ONZM thumb right 300px The Auckland Symphony Orchestra in concert at the Last Night of the Proms in 2004 The ASO has developed a following and reputation for high quality performances of popular classics from the symphonic repertoire and music from stage and screen , often playing to capacity and turn away audiences Its eighty plus players are drawn from all parts of Auckland and from all walks of life , including professional people who have chosen a career outside of music The ASO provides an opportunity to these people to enjoy weekly rehearsals of symphonic music , playing without payment and purely for the pleasure of making good music together It also supports local young soloists , giving them the opportunity to perform in concert with a full symphony orchestra The orchestra 's main philosophy is that music should be fun and enjoyed by players and audiences alike hence the regular Free Family concerts that are offered in Auckland with out of town concerts in areas where a live performance by a symphony orchestra is a rare event Regular annual features of the orchestra are the Free Family concerts , performances of Last Night of the Proms and the Christmas Sing Along with local Pacific Island church choirs The current music director conductor of the ASO is Peter Thomas History The First Thirty Five Years , 1975 2010 The Auckland Symphony Orchestra was formed as a result of a 30th anniversary reunion of players from the Auckland Junior Symphony Orchestra \(

musical theatre conductor , was given the task of directing the reunion orchestra of some eighty players Music was chosen from past programmes , on only three rehearsals The full contingent of players did not appear until the performance night Based upon the success of the reunion many of the players expressed an interest for forming a permanent orchestra Gary Daverne was chosen as music director
