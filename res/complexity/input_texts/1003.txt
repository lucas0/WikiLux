thumb 220px right Lord Monboddo , pencil sketch by John Brown , circa 1777 James Burnett , Lord Monboddo \( October 25 , 1714 May 26 , 1799 \) was a Scottish judge , scholar of language evolution and philosopher He is most famous today as a founder of modern comparative historical linguistics \( Hobbs , 1992 \) In 1767 he became a judge in the Court of Session , effectively the supreme court of Scotland Thence Burnett adopted a title based on his father 's estate , Monboddo House Monboddo is considered by a number of scholars to have developed the concepts of evolution seventy years before Darwin , as summarized in the history of evolutionary thought Early years James Burnett was born in 1714 at Monboddo House in Kincardineshire , Scotland After his primary education at the parish school of Laurencekirk , he studied at Marischal College , Aberdeen where he was graduated in 1729 He also studied at Edinburgh University and the University of Groningen At Edinburgh University he was graduated at law and was admitted to the Scottish Bar in 1737 Burnett married Elizabeth Farquharson and they had two daughters and a son Burnett 's youngest daughter Elizabeth Burnett was an Edinburgh celebrity , known for her beauty and amiability Tragically she died of consumption at the age of 25 Burnett 's friend Robert Burns had a romantic interest in Eliza and wrote a poem referencing her beauty and which ultimately became her elegy His early work in practicing law found him in a landmark litigation of his time , called the Douglas case The matter involved the inheritance standing of a young heir and took on the form of a mystery novel of the era , with a complex web of events spanning Scotland , France and England Burnett , as the solicitor for the young Douglas heir , was victorious after years of legal battle and appeals left 200px thumb Seal of the Court of Session Crown Copyright Later years as patron of the arts and Court of Session Justice From 1754 until 1767 Monboddo was one of a number of distinguished proprietors of the Canongate Theatre He clearly enjoyed this endeavor even when some of his fellow judges pointed out that the activity might cast a shadow over his somber image as jurist Here he had occasion to further associate with David Hume who was a principal actor in one of the plays He had actually met Hume earlier when Monboddo was a curator of the Advocates Library and David Hume served as keeper of that library for several years while he wrote his history In the era after Monboddo was appointed to Justice of the high court , he organized learned suppers at his house in St John Street , where he discussed and lectured about his theories Local intellectuals were invited to attend attic repasts , regular guests including Burns , Samuel Johnson and James Boswell Henry Home , Lord Kames was conspicuously absent from such socializing while Kames and Monboddo served on the high court at the same time and had numerous interactions , they were staunch intellectual rivals Historical linguistics In The Origin and Progress of Language he painstakingly analyzes the structure of primitive and modern languages that argues that mankind had evolved language skills in response to his changing environment and altering social structures His work in language evolution departed radically from then existing theories This analysis was totally remarkable , since Burnett was partially deaf He was intrigued with the systematics he discovered in codifying a multitude of primitive languages Burnett was the first to discover that primitive languages actually create unnecessarily lengthy words for rather simple concepts He reasoned that in early languages there was an imperative for clarity , so that redundancy was built in and seemingly unnecessary syllables added He reasoned that this form of language evolved as a method of survival when clear communication might be the determinant of avoiding danger He demonstrated at many junctures in his analysis that he was aware of the concept of evolution and of natural selection of those peoples who could develop superior language skills This concept , while transparent in current times , bordered on heresy Ironically , Burnett was deeply religious and often digressed to credit God with the divine first mover concept as argued in a similar vein by Aristotle Monboddo studied in great detail a number of primitive languages including the Carib , Eskimo , Huron , Algonquin , Peruvian and Tahitian languages He was the first to see the preponderance of polysyllabic words , where most of his predecessors had summarily dismissed primitive language as a series of monosyllabic grunts He also made the astute observation that in Huron \( or Wyandot \) the words for very similar objects are astoundingly different This fact made Monboddo to understand that primitive peoples needed to communicate reliably regarding a more limited number of subjects than in modern civilizations , which led to the polysyllabic and redundant nature of many words He also was apparently the first to establish that primitive languages are generally vowel rich correspondingly , very late advanced languages such as German and English are in the opposite sense vowel starved Partially this disparity arises from the greater vocabulary of modern languages and the decreased need for the polysyllabic content Monboddo also traced the evolution of modern European languages and gave particularly great effort to understanding the ancient Greek language , in which he was proficient He argued that Greek is the most perfect language ever established because of its complex structure and tonality , rendering it capable of expressing a wide gamut of nuances Evolutionary theorist thumb right 200px Monboddo exerted great effort in analyzing man 's relation to other species \( photo courtesy of Don Roberson \) Monboddo is considered by many \( Cloyd , 1972 \) , \( Gray , 1929 \) , \( Lovejoy , 1933 \) as a precursive thinker in the theory of evolution Most modern evolution historians do not give Monboddo a standing consistent with his contributions in the influence of the history of evolution Lovejoy clearly states that Monboddo has suggested the concept of organic evolution in his comparison to Rousseau Monboddo has developed the evolutionary ideas far more fully by most educated persons in Great Britain in the 17 80s he was probably looked upon as their originator and he with some wavering extended Rousseau 's doctrine of the identity of species of man and the chimp into the hypothesis of common descent of all the anthropoids , and suggested by implication a general law of evolution Lord Neaves , one of Monboddo 's successors on the high court of Scotland believed that proper credit \( Neaves , 1875 \) was not given to Monboddo in evolutionary theory development Neaves wrote in poetic form Though Darwin now proclaims the law And sreads it far abroad , O ! The man that first the secret saw Was honest old Monboddo The architect precedence takes Of him that bears the hod , O ! So up and at them , Land of Cakes , We 'll vindicate Monboddo Erasmus Darwin clearly notes Monboddo 's work in his publications \( Darwin , 1803 \) Later scholars and historical writers knowledgeable of evolutionary theory , such as E L Cloyd \( Cloyd , 1972 \) and W Forbes Gray \( Gray , 1929 \) consider Monboddo 's analysis as precursive theory to the theory of Evolution In any event , Maupertuis is known to have outlined the basic principles of natural selection far in advance \( 1745 \) of the English writers Whether Charles Darwin read Monboddo is not certain , although his grandfather 's understanding \( Darwin , 1803 \) of Monboddo 's thought is an indication that Charles Darwin may have drawn ideas from him In regard to his contemporaries , Monboddo debated with Buffon regarding man 's relationship to other primates Buffon thought that man was a species unrelated to lower primates , but Monboddo rejected Buffon 's analysis and argued that the anthropoidal ape must be related to the species of man Partly because of Monboddo 's deeply religious thought , it was difficult for him to place the apes on an equal plane with man , so he sometimes referred to the anthropoidal ape as the brother of man Monboddo suffered a setback in his standing on evolutionary thought , because he claimed that men had caudal appendages some historians failed to take him very seriously after that remark , even though Monboddo was known to bait his critics with preposterous sayings In terms of more recent evolutionary analysis the 2005 publication of The Holly and the Horn \( Bailey , 2005 \) states that Charles Darwin was to some degree influenced by the theories of Monboddo who deserves the title of Eolutionist more than that of Eccentric Further Jan Andrew Henderson states in his publication The Emperor 's Kilt The Two Secret Histories of Scotland that Monboddoo was the first to articulate the theory of natural selection He Monboddo was a minor celebrity in Edinburgh because he was considered to be very eccentric But he actually came up with the idea that men may have evolved instead of being created by God His views were dismissed because people thought he was mad and in those days it was a very controversial view to hold But he felt it was a logical possibility and it caused him a great deal of consternation He actually did not want to believe the theory because he was a very religious person In his linguistic analysis , he is probably the first person to associate language skills evolving from primates and continuing to evolve in primitive man \( Monboddo , 1773 \) He writes specifically about how the language capability has altered over time in the form not only of skills but physical form of the sound producing organs \( mouth , vocal chords , tongue , throat \) , suggesting he had formed the concept of evolutionary adaptive change He also elaborates on the advantages created by the adaptive change of primates to their environment and even to the evolving complexity of primate social structures As an agriculturist and horse breeder , Monboddo was quite aware of the significance of selective breeding and even transferred this breeding theory to communications he had with James Boswell in Boswell 's selection of a mate ! Monboddo has stated in his own works that degenerative qualities can be inherited by successive generations and that by selective choice of mates , creatures can improve the next generation in a biological sense It is also noteworthy that Monboddo , like his contemporaries that were deeply religious , never undermined the existence of God , referred to the Adam and Eve account as an allegory That is a strong indication that Monboddo understood the role of natural processes in evolution , since Monboddo was a vigorous opponent of other scientific thinking that philosophically questioned the role of God \( See particularly Monboddo 's prolific diatribes on Newton 's theories \) It is interesting as Cloyd notes that Monboddo struggled with how to get man from an animal without divine intervention , because of his religious beliefs He developed an entire theory of language evolution around the Egyptian civilization to assist in his understanding of how man descended from animals , since he explained the flowering of language upon the spinoff of the Egyptians imparting language skills to other cultures Monboddo cast man in his primitive state to be a wild , solitary , herbivorous quadruped He believed that contemporary man suffered many diseases because he had removed himself from his natural state in the environment of being unclothed and exposed to extreme swings in climate Metaphysics In Antient Metaphysics , Burnett claimed that man is gradually elevating himself from the animal condition to a state in which mind acts independently of the body He was a strong supporter of Aristotle in his concepts of Prime Mover Much effort was devoted to crediting Isaac Newton with brilliant discoveries in the Laws of Motion , while defending the power of the mind as outlined by Aristotle His analysis was further complicated by his recurring need to assure that Newton did not obviate the presence of God An eccentric Burnett was widely known to be an eccentric He often asserted that he followed practices of the ancient Greeks to keep in good physical condition Accordingly when he came out of court one day in a downpour , he calmly placed his wig in his sedan chair and walked home Habitually he rode on horseback between Edinburgh and London instead of journeying by carriage Another time after a decision against him regarding the value of a horse , he refused to sit with the other judges and assumed a seat below the bench with the court clerks When Burnett was visiting the King 's Court in London in 1787 , part of the ceiling of the courtroom started to collapse People rushed out of the building but Burnett who , at the age of 71 , was partially deaf and shortsighted , was the only one not move When he was later asked for a reason , he stated that he thought it an annual ceremony , with which , as an alien , he had nothing to do Finally one must remark that Burnett seemed strangely obsessed with man 's relation to other primates He clearly believed that the orangutan was a form of man furthermore , he accepted an account of a Swedish explorer that reported one primitive tribe had tails Most astonishingly , he at one time said that humans must have all been born with tails , that were simply removed by midwives at birth His contemporaries ridiculed his views , but many later commentators have seen him preceding the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin In any case in his serious analysis he clearly argued that animal species adapted and changed to survive , and his observations on the adaptive progression of primates to man underscored his clear concepts of evolution Publications of Lord Monboddo The Origin and Progress of Language \( 6 volumes , 1773 1792 \) Antient Metaphysics \( 6 volumes , 1779 1799
