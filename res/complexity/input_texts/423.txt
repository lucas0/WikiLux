thumb The Sony SLT design features a pellicle mirror which allows light to strike both the digital image sensor \( parallel to the lens mount , behind mirror \) and phase detection autofocus sensor \( perpendicular to the mount \) at all times Single lens translucent \( SLT \) is a Sony proprietary designation for Sony Alpha cameras which employ a pellicle mirror , electronic viewfinder , and phase detection autofocus system They employ the same Minolta A mount as Sony Alpha DSLR cameras Sony SLT cameras have a semi transparent fixed mirror which diverts a portion of incoming light to a phase detection autofocus sensor , while the remaining light strikes a digital image sensor The image sensor feeds the electronic viewfinder , and also records still images and video on command The utility of the SLT design is to allow full time phase detection autofocus during electronic viewfinder , live view , and video recording operation With the advent of digital image sensors with integrated phase detection , the SLT design is no longer required to accomplish this goal , as evidenced by cameras such as the Sony NEX 5R , Fujifilm X 100s , and Nikon 1 , although the SLT design avoids having pixels unavailable for image formation due to their space on the sensor being occupied by a dedicated phase detection autofocus sensel The term translucent is a misnomer for the actual SLT design , which employs a pellicle mirror that is not translucent Pellicle mirrors have been used in single lens reflex cameras from at least the 1960s \( see Canon Pellix \) List of SLT cameras thumb Sony Alpha 55 Model Megapixels Sensor Screen Built in flash Sony Alpha 33 14 MP APS C 3 articulated \( pop up \) Sony Alpha 35 16 MP APS C 3 fixed \( pop up \) Sony Alpha 37 16 MP APS C 2 7 tilting \( pop up \) Sony Alpha 55 16 MP APS C 3 articulated \( pop up \) Sony Alpha 57 16 MP APS C 3 articulated \( pop up \) Sony Alpha 58 20 MP APS C 2 7 tilting \( pop up \) Sony Alpha 65 24 MP APS C 3 articulated \( pop up \) Sony Alpha 68 24 MP APS C 2 7 tilting \( pop up \) Sony Alpha 77 24 MP APS C 3 fully articulated \( pop up \) Sony Alpha 77 II 24 MP APS C 3 fully articulated \( pop up \) Sony Alpha 99 24 MP 3 fully articulated Sony Alpha 99II 42 MP 3 fully articulated All of the above cameras record 1920x1080 video at 60i 30p , in MPEG 4 , AVCHD or H 264 formats The Alpha 99II also records 4k video at 100Mbit s \( using XAVC S \) with full sensor read out Source summarised from the full comparison table at DP Review See also Digital single lens reflex camera Sony ILCA camera References
