would be their last studio effort Pop Matters We Do n't Die , We Multiply History Formation Jacobs spent most of his youth in Tampa , Florida and New York City Founded in 1987 , the group 's image was originally more militant , and was intended to be a tribute to social activists The Black Panthers However , when Public Enemy became a prominent band , Jacobs chose to take the image in a more whimsical direction Sex Packets Sex Packets , the group 's debut album , was released in the spring of 1990 following the success of its two lead off singles First came Doowutchyalike , a moderate club hit , followed by the more successful song The Humpty Dance , a humorous dance number that reached 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 , 7 on the R B charts , and 1 on the Billboard Rap Singles chart It was rapped by Shock G 's alter ego Humpty Hump , and featured a drum track with over 50 confirmed usages in other songs Sex Packets features P Funk samples , jazz influenced interludes , and a combination of samples and live instrumentation , earning it positive reviews and platinum sales This Is an EP Release This Is an EP Release is the RIAA Gold certified second Digital Underground release , from which two songs , Tie the Knot and Same Song were featured in the film Nothing But Trouble starring Dan Aykroyd , Chevy Chase , Demi Moore , and John Candy Tie The Knot , features jazzy piano tracks and a comedic interpretation of Bridal Chorus Same Song has an organ solo and improvised organ bits throughout the song , making it one of hip hop 's first singles to successfully integrate live instrumentation with music samples Tupac Shakur made his debut on the latter song and portrayed an African king in the video Tupac also can be heard joking around on the remixed version of The Way We Swing as a background vocalist , adding humorous ad libs between the verses Tupac first began to appear on stage with the group as one of its dancers and hype men Sons of the P The group 's third album featured two singles , No Nose Job and Kiss You Back , the latter of which featured multi layered choruses and background vocals sung by Boni Boyer , who briefly worked with Digital Underground shortly after her stint with Prince 's Sign of the Times Love Sexy band Despite the fact that a choir of singers were portrayed in the video , the actual studio singing was exclusively Boni on all tracks , excluding the male voices It has been mistakenly reported that Kiss You Back was co written and co performed by George Clinton , but his name appears in the writers credit due to a sample of \( Not Just \) Knee Deep by Funkadelic being used He did , however , actively participate in the writing and recording of the title track Sons of the P , which he also contributed vocals to , and which marked one of the earliest studio guest appearances by Clinton on a Hip Hop release , which is preceded only by Kurtis Blow 's Magilla Gorilla released in 1986 Both the album and the Kiss You Back single were each certified Gold by the RIAA thumb left 300px alt Lead vocalist Shock G in 1991 during the group 's Sons of the P tour Lead vocalist Shock G in 1991 during the group 's Sons of the P tour The Body Hat Syndrome With the leading single The Return of the Crazy One , and its accompanying X rated video , which was reworked for public consumption , gaining positive feedback , the rest of The Body Hat Syndrome unfurled to less than outstanding crossover commercial acclaim The album 's second single , an anti racism cultural awareness politico called Wussup Wit the Luv , featured a solo from Funkadelic guitarist Michael Hampton , as well as a verse and video appearance from Tupac Shakur This would be the last time Tupac appeared on any Digital Underground release , while lead rappers Saafir and Clee were added to the band 's line up This album also features The Humpty Dance Awards , the group 's humorous shout out to the artists who sampled the Humpty Dance prior to 1993 Future Rhythm Future Rhythm , the group 's fifth album , would be the band 's first independent release , and it spawned two songs that were featured in the Wayans brothers' film Do n't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood The songs are Food Fight , which featured Del tha Funkee Homosapien , and We Got More with Luniz The latter is featured twice on the soundtrack once as a full song , and once as an intro edited to the beginning of Winter Wars by Ghostface Killa The album also contains an early performance from rapper Sly Boogy , while he was still a member of the Black Spooks , who appeared on the song Fool Get a Clue Who Got the Gravy \? In 1998 , eight years after the group 's first release , Digital Underground released Who Got the Gravy \? , which reached 91 on the Top 200 R B Hip Hop Albums charts The album intentionally featured several East Coast rappers at a time when the East vs West rivalry was active , in an attempt to both ignore and ridicule it The guests included New York City natives Big Pun , Biz Markie and KRS One , and introduced Whuteva and Stylez , while also introducing west coast bay area newcomers Esinchill and female emcee Mystic Cuz A D U Party Do n't Stop !
