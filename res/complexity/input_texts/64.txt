originated it for The American Ad Council in 1947 Keep America Beautiful joined with the Ad Council in 1961 to dramatize the idea that every individual must help protect against the terrible effects

competition and benchmarking tool for K 12 school recycling programs to promote waste reduction activities School recycling programs across the nation compete in a race to collect the most recyclables The competition is open to all elementary , middle and high schools and individual classrooms Public , private and charter schools are eligible Recycle Bowl participants track and report how much material they collect during the four week competition timeframe in the fall semester School wide competitions may compete for national prizes RecycleMania RecycleMania is a friendly competition and benchmarking tool for college and university recycling programs to promote waste reduction activities to their campus communities Over a 8 week period each spring , schools report recycling and trash data which are then ranked according to collected recyclables per capita , total recyclables , recycling rate , and the least amount of trash per capita While the stated goal for RecycleMania is to have a fair and friendly recycling competition , the program s underlying value is to help campuses increase recycling and waste reduction activity by raising awareness among students and staff and by providing the catalyst for colleges and universities to build and expand their programs on campus RecycleMania participation in many cases puts a recycling program on the front page of the campus paper , helping to build administrative recognition and support It also provides a promotional opportunity to showcase new collection or waste reduction activities By focusing on performance metrics , the program encourages campus efforts to benchmark improvement over time RecycleMania began in 2001 when the recycling coordinators at Ohio University and Miami University , looking for a way to motivate their campuses , challenged each other to see which one could collect the most recycling Miami went on to beat Ohio that first year and RecycleMania was born RecycleMania has been gaining momentum ever since , involving 630 campuses in 2011 RecycleMania is a trademarked program of the RecycleMania Steering Committee , with management support provided by Keep America Beautiful Littering Is Wrong Too Launched largely online in 2011 , the Littering is Wrong Too campaign utilizes social media , street teams and viral marketing to engage young adults in an untraditional dialogue about litter It links littering with other undeniable and often humorous wrongdoings , such as eating gas station sushi , texting during surgery or giving a kid sugar at bedtime The campaign is designed to create a dialogue about the problem of litter , creating a foundation to build awareness and affect long term behavior change The campaign is being executed across the country through Keep America Beautiful s national network of affiliates , which bring the campaign to the streets at public events and through traditional media Cigarette Litter Prevention In response to data showing cigarette butts to be by far the most commonly littered item in America , KAB launched a national Cigarette Litter Prevention Program in 2003 The campaign targets areas most likely to be littered by smokers known as transition points , or areas adjacent to entryways , transit stations , or public spaces where smoking is not allowed Dining and entertainment districts , where large numbers of smokers tend to congregate outdoors , are also targeted The program provides framework and incentives to local organizations \( KAB affiliates , chambers of commerce , downtown associations , business improvement districts , etc \) to place ash receptacles in appropriate locations and to provide public education on the issue of cigarette litter Since its inception , the program has resulted in average reductions of 45 in the areas where it has been implemented Classroom Programs and Youth Education KAB provides resources for teachers , after school programs , homeschooling and other educational settings Its Waste In Place module on solid waste management was created in 1978 and has undergone several subsequent updates and revisions In 2002 , the organization launched an online version of

in America , among others http www kab org site PageServer \? pagename partners nonprofit Criticism Heather Rogers , creator of the documentary film Gone Tomorrow The Hidden Life of Garbage and book of the same name , classifies Keep America Beautiful as one of the first greenwashing corporate fronts , alleging that the group was created in response to Vermont 's 1953 attempt to outlaw disposable containers The focus on litter , and indeed construction of the modern concept of litter , is seen as an attempt to divert responsibility from industries that rely on disposable products to the consumer that improperly disposes of them Elizabeth Royte author of Garbage Land , describes Keep America Beautiful as a masterful example of corporate greenwash , writing that in contrast to its anti litter campaigns , it ignores the potential of recycling legislation and resists changes to packaging Garbage Land page 184 See also Clean Up the World Container deposit legislation Do n't Mess with
