University Conservative Association \( CUCA \) is a long established political society going back to 1921 , with roots in the late nineteenth century , as a Conservative branch for students at Cambridge University in England It is looked upon by the Conservative Party as a training ground for future party leaders History The earliest incarnation of the Cambridge University Conservative Association was established in 1882 , but lasted only a few months before dissolving The Bristol Mercury and Daily Post \( Bristol , England \) , Monday , May 15 , 1882 Issue 10608 By 1884 , it was necessary for Cambridge Conservatives to launch a new group the Cambridge University Carlton Club Daily News \( London , England \) , Thursday , May 8 , 1884 Issue 11878 This served primarily as a dining society , and existed for the next twenty years However , shortly after the Conservative government 's landslide defeat in the 1906 general election , the CU Carlton Club dissolved , just as its predecessor had There was no Conservative student organisation in Cambridge for the remainder of the Edwardian period , and the First World War saw party political activity suspended The present day Cambridge University Conservative Association was founded in 1921 , with its inaugural annual dinner held on 24 January of that year The Times , Tuesday , Jan 25 , 1921 page 10 Issue 42627 col B In 1928 , the annual St John 's College magazine The Eagle defined a Cambridge Conservative association member as the proud possessor of a certain tie , obtained by signifying with a subscription his refusal or his inability to think out any social question T E B Howarth , Cambridge Between Two Wars \( Collins , London , 1978 \) p 152 CUCA alumni had considerable influence on British politics in the 1980s and and 1990s , with the rise to prominence of the 'Cambridge Mafia' including cabinet ministers Michael Howard , Kenneth Clarke , John Gummer and Norman Lamont , who had dominated CUCA and the Cambridge Union in the early 1960s Considerable overlap between the officeholders of the two societies continues to the present day Activities CUCA holds regular speaker meetings with Conservative politicians and thinkers , as well as campaigning for the Conservatives in elections CUCA has a well established history of attracting a high calibre of speakers , often including Cabinet ministers , think tank experts and even former Prime Ministers Recent visitors have included John Major , Michael Howard and Eric Pickles The Association also hosts frequent social events and policy discussions , including Thinking and Drinking evenings , policy pub meets , Port and Cheese evenings , cross party events and the termly Chairman 's Dinner , which marks the handing over of the leadership from one chairman to another High turnouts at these events point to an interested and active society membership CUCA is the largest of the three main Cambridge University party political associations Life membership can be purchased for 10 , and membership for one academic year costs 5 It is run by an executive of six the Chairman , Vice Chairman , Junior Treasurer , Campaigns Office , Secretary and Registrar They are supported by a Committee of up to eight people , who are often assigned to sub committees to examine various pressing issues Following constitutional changes passed in Lent 2009 , the Vice Chairman automatically becomes Chairman in the term following their Vice Chairmanship CUCA controversies 1938 Pro Appeasement CUCA has not been without controversy over the years In 1938 , CUCA hosted Sir Samuel Hoare as he gave a vigorous defence of Neville Chamberlain 's policy of appeasement towards Hitler at Munich , calling it a great achievement and the height of exaltation The Times , Friday , Nov 25 , 1938 pg 9 Issue 48161 col A 1956 Support for the Suez invasion In reporting and listing widespread student protests across Britain against the invasion of Suez in 1956 , The Times noted one exception Cambridge University Conservative Association sent telegrams of support to the Prime Minister \( Sir Anthony Eden \) and Foreign Secretary \( Selwyn Lloyd \) The Times , Saturday , Nov 03 , 1956 pg 4 Issue 53679 col E 1960 1 Visits by Sir Oswald Mosley In 1961 , Conservative leader to be Michael Howard resigned in protest at Kenneth Clarke 's decision to invite former British Union of Fascists leader Oswald Mosley to speak to the association for the second year running \( The previous year 's speech by Mosley had been marred by a heckler throwing jelly at Sir Oswald \) The Times , Monday , Apr 25 , 1960 pg 7 Issue 54754 col C 1985 6 Visits by Enoch Powell A visit by Enoch Powell in March 1985 provoked resignations on CUCA 's committee , The Times , Monday

1989 \) , page 13 CUCA had also come under criticism for Powell 's 1985 appearance in the New Statesman , which argued that Powell 's extreme views were indicative of CUCA 's alleged authoritarianism , and the paper asserting the \( short lived \) Cambridge University Monday Club form part of an unholy alliance with elements of the Left and the now discredited Cambridge University Conservative Association , who are united in their fervent , even violent opposition to libertarians Perhaps it is this bizarre grouping which deserves investigation The New Statesman , Volume 109 , page 25 \( 1985 \) In October 1968 , a previous visit by Enoch Powell just five months after his Rivers of Blood speech , during the CUCA Chairmanship of Howard Flight , saw mass protests in Cambridge , and was reported by The Times The Times , Tuesday , Oct 08 , 1968 pg 3 Issue 57376 col A 1965 2000 Allegations of electoral malpractice The society has , in the past , occasionally hit the headlines of local and national papers over electoral disputes and allegations of malpractice In 1965 , The Times reported that CUCA 's Secretary was forced to resign after a four and a half hour meeting deemed some of his election methods to have been forbidden The Times , Friday , Dec 03 , 1965 pg 6 Issue 56495 col F In 1985 , The Times reported that eight committee members of CUCA had resigned after allegations of electoral irregularities , with one committee member having a tape recording which he claimed proved the allegations The Times , Monday , Feb 04 , 1985 pg 2 Issue 62053 col H In early 1998 ,

Conservative MP \( and CUCA alumnus \) Timothy Eggar , describing him as , one of those unpleasant political operators that Cambridge University Conservative Association alone knows how to breed Private Eye , No 472 , 18 January 1980 , p 5 \( 1980 \) In 1992 The Economist wrote that competition to rise to the top of CUCA is good preparation for a political career in the Conservative Party , for several reasons Ideology counts for nothing What matters is knowing how to make friends and when to stab them in the back If you cut your political teeth at CUCA , you are liable to end up sporting a sharp set of fangs In November 1998 , it was noted in Varsity that outgoing Chairmen of CUCA were awarded a pair of silver cufflinks \( though this is no longer the case \) , and it was alleged by a committee member that Several of the last Chairmen only served their terms of office so that they could get the cufflinks Varsity , 19 November 1998 , p 9 In 2005 The Daily Telegraph
