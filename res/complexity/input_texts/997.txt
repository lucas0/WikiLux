and its UK subsidiary , Philips Peter Leni Gillman \( 1986 \) Alias David Bowie a biography p 172 Mercury executives had heard an audition tape that included a demo of Space Oddity recorded by Bowie and Hutchinson in spring 1969 Next Bowie tried to find a producer George Martin turned the project down , while Tony Visconti liked the album demo tracks , but considered the planned lead off single , Space Oddity , a 'cheap shot' at the impending Apollo 11 space mission Visconti decided to delegate its production to Gus Dudgeon Life on Two Legs Biography by Norman Sheffield The album version of Space Oddity \( 5 15 \) was recorded at Trident Studios on 20 June 1969 \( with overdubs a few days later \) and used the in house session player Rick Wakeman \( Mellotron \) , who was later to achieve fame with the progressive rock band Yes , as well as Mick Wayne \( guitar \) , Herbie Flowers \( bass \) , and Terry Cox \( drums \) Bowie sang lead and harmony vocals and played acoustic guitar and the Stylophone Chris O'Leary \( 2015 \) Rebel Rebel p 99 Differing edits of the album version were released as singles , in the UK \( mono , 4 33 \) , the US \( mono and stereo , 3 26 \) , and several other countries The original UK mono single edit was included on Re Call 1 , part of the Five Years \( 1969 1973 \) box set , in 2015 The song was promoted in advertisements for the Stylophone , played by Bowie on the record and heard in the background during the opening verse The single was not played by the BBC until after the Apollo 11 crew had safely returned after this slow start , the song reached No 5 in the UK Singles Chart In the US , it stalled at 124 Besides its title , which alludes to the film 2001 A Space Odyssey , the introduction to the song is a barely audible instrumental build up that is analogous to the deep bass tone in Also sprach Zarathustra that is prominently used in the film On 2 October 1969 , Bowie performed the song for an episode of Top of the Pops However , this was recorded separate from the main audience The performance was shown on 9 October the following week , and repeated on 16 October At present , the performance is 'missing' due to the BBC 's late junking policy The release was timed by the record company to align with the moon landing , and so Bowie was considered for a time a novelty act , especially since he would not have another hit for three years Mogol wrote Italian lyrics for the song , and Bowie recorded a new vocal in December 1969 , releasing the single Ragazzo solo , ragazza sola \( Lonely Boy , Lonely Girl \) in Italy Upon its re release as a single in 1973 , Space Oddity reached No 15 on the Billboard Chart and became Bowie 's first hit single in the United States in Canada , it reached No 16 This was then used to support RCA 's 1975 UK reissue , which gave Bowie his first No 1 single in the UK Singles Chart in November that year It spent two weeks at the top of that chart Bowie recorded a stripped down , acoustic version of Space Oddity in late 1979 , Chris O'Leary \( 2015 \) Rebel Rebel pp 99 , 107 which was issued in February 1980 as the B side of Alabama Song The 1979 recording was

1977 1982 \) compilation , in 2017 On 20 July 2009 , the single was reissued on a digital EP that features the original UK and US mono single edits , a subsequent US stereo single edit , and the 1979 rerecording , as well as stems that allow listeners to remix the song This release coincided with the 40th anniversary of the song and the Apollo 11 moon landing The 50th anniversary of the single was marked on 12 July 2019 by the release , on digital and vinyl singles , of a new remix of the song by Tony Visconti The vinyl version , issued in a box set , also included the original UK mono single edit Demo versions There were also several demos recorded in early 1969 , four of which have since had an official commercial release An early demo was recorded in approximately late January 1969 Chris O'Leary \( 2015 \) Rebel Rebel p 98 This demo differs greatly from the album version , with only an acoustic guitar and Stylophone present as instruments The vocals in this demo were provided by Bowie and Hutchinson Hutchinson sang the lead vocals of the Ground Control section up until This is Major Tom to Ground Control , while Bowie sang the harmony vocals When the aforementioned lyric begins , however , the source of the lead vocals switches to Bowie as he continues to provide them for the rest of the song Hutchinson played the acoustic guitar , while Bowie played the Stylophone The demo remained officially unreleased for more than 40 years until it appeared on the 2009 two CD special edition of the album David Bowie It made its vinyl debut in May 2019 on a box set titled Clareville Grove Demos Two even earlier demos of Space Oddity , including a fragment that may be the first recorded demo of the song , were released for the first time in April 2019 , on Spying Through a Keyhole , a vinyl box set Bowie and Hutchinson recorded another demo version in approximately mid April 1969 That recording appeared , with edits , as the opening track on the 1989 box set

Chris Hadfield version In May 2013 , Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield , commander of Expedition 35 to the International Space Station , recorded a video of the song on the space station which went viral and generated a great deal of media exposure The lyrics were somewhat altered instead of losing communication with ground control and presumably being lost in space as a result , Major Tom successfully receives his orders to land and does so safely , reflecting Hadfield 's imminent return from his final mission on the Station Hadfield announced the video on his Twitter account , writing , With deference to the genius of David Bowie , here 's Space Oddity , recorded on Station A last glimpse of the World Bowie was also thanked in the ending credits This was the first music video ever shot in space Bowie 's social media team responded to the video , tweeting back to Hadfield , Hallo Spaceboy and would later call the cover possibly the most poignant version of the song ever created The performance was the subject of a piece by Glenn Fleishman in The Economist on 22 May 2013 analyzing the legal implications of publicly performing a copyrighted work of music while in earth orbit The song is the only one of Bowie 's for which Bowie did not own the copyright Bowie 's publisher granted Hadfield a license to the song for only one year Due to the expiry of the one year licence , the official video was taken offline on 13 May 2014 , despite Bowie 's explicit wishes that the publisher grant Hadfield a license at no charge to record the song and produce the video Following a period of negotiations , the video was restored to YouTube on 2 November 2014 with a two year licence agreement in place See also Ashes to Ashes \( David Bowie song \) Hallo Spaceboy Blackstar \( song
