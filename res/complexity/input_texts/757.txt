The Fight Against Coercive Tactics Network , or FACTNet , is an organization committed to educating and facilitating communication about destructive mind control Coercive tactics , or coercive psychological systems are described on their website as unethical mind control such as brainwashing , thought reform , destructive persuasion and coercive persuasion While this appears to cover a massive array of issues , in practice FACTNet 's primary dedication is to the exposure and disruption of cult activity In 2002 FACTNet expanded its mission statement to include mind control and unethical influence as found in governments , corporations , social organizations , advertising marketing , political organizations , the military and family groups Mission FACTNet summarizes its mission as protecting freedom of mind , and cites as its guiding precept the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief , specifically its first article which includes the statement that no one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his ability to have a religion or belief of his choice This is described more palatably in the slogan which is featured prominently on their website We are to destructive cults , fundamentalism , mind control , and mental coercion torture what Amnesty International is to physical torture Execution FACTNet uses its website as a hub for discussion and communication , facilitating connections between cult victims , former cult members , and professional counselors FACTNet is often used to refer specifically to the extensive forums and discussion boards found there The organization also uses the internet to distribute materials on mind control and destructive cults electronically , and to educate people on the signs of harmful mind control and prevention The home page features timely news posts highlighting cults and anti cult activity in the news and media In the news In 1995 FACTNet was featured in the news due to a lawsuit regarding the seizure of FACTNet servers and files by the Religious Technology Center \( RTC \) , an organization created by the Church of Scientology to oversee the protection of all its trademarks and copyrights In August 1995 RTC lawyers went to a Denver judge alleging copyright infringement and illegal use of scientology documents by FACTNet , a vocal critic of the religion 's practices It was later revealed that the lawyers failed to inform the judge that FACTNet was a non profit electronic library and archive The judge was convinced to grant a search and seizure order for all of FACTNet 's electronic resources A raid of two directors' homes was conducted on August 21 , 1995 by two U S marshals and six RTC representatives , with the actual search for incriminating documents conducted by the RTC alone Witnesses of the searches testified to the fact that the marshals allowed the RTC representatives to go far beyond the scope of the order in their search for information The marshals also failed to search the representatives before or after the search , making it possible for them to possibly carry off disks and other documents containing critical information FACTNet immediately accused the Church of Scientology of attempting to silence their voice by stealing and contaminating information vital to their continued attacks and potential lawsuits against the Church FACTNet filed a lawsuit , and on September 14 , 1995 a Federal judge ruled in their favor , ordering the RTC to return all computers and files that were seized Nevertheless , FACTNet claimed to have incurred irreparable damage , as the secrecy of its documents had already been violated by the RTC If indeed the RTC had intended to silence FACTNet , however , they only caused more harm , as the raid gave FACTNet a rallying point and a new example of intimidation and harassment by the Church of Scientology to support their critical views 11 years later , the raid is still well documented and archived on their website , including a detailed analysis of what it was really all about FACTNet has maintained a relatively low news profile since 1995 , occasionally cited for speaking out against topics they consider important The 2000 film Battlefield Earth starring John Travolta stirred up controversy because it was based on a book by L R Hubbard , the founder of the Church of Scientology , and Travolta was a well known church member Even more recently , FACTNet spoke out in support of a South Park episode that received media attention for its parody of Scientology Controversy and criticism The FACTNet forums inevitably are host to threads regarding not only cults widely accepted as destructive , but also criticism of mainstream religions Casual viewers of the forums are bound to find content that they disagree or are offended about While this is nothing new and is an unavoidable aspect of online communities , it has nonetheless generated some controversy concerning what the organization really stands for Such criticisms seldom go far , as FACTNet is founded upon the deliberately broad ideal of freedom of mind It is dedicated to allowing people to think however they want , not a particular religion Links FACTNet Homepage
