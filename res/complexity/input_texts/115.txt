newly industrialized country \( NIC \) is a socioeconomic classification applied to several countries around the world by political scientists and economists They represent a subset of developing countries whose economic growth is much higher than other developing countries and where the social consequences of industrialization , such as urbanization , are reorganizing society Definition NICs are countries whose economies have not yet reached a developed country 's status but have , in a macroeconomic sense , outpaced their developing counterparts Such countries are still considered developing nations and only differ from other developing nations in the rate at which an NIC 's growth is much higher over a shorter allotted time period compared to other developing nations http www

oriented \) Incipient or ongoing industrialization is an important indicator of an NIC In many NICs , social upheaval can occur as primarily rural , or agricultural , populations migrate to the cities , where the growth of manufacturing concerns and factories can draw many thousands of laborers NIC 's introduce many new immigrants looking to improve their social and or political status thorough newly formed democracies and the increase in wages that most individuals who partake in such changes would obtain https www imf org external pubs ft wp 2016 wp16207 pdf Characteristics of newly industrialized countries Newly industrialized countries can bring about an increase of stabilization in a country 's social and economic status , allowing the people living in these nations to begin to experience better living conditions and better lifestyles Another characteristic that appears in newly industrialized countries is the further development in government structures , such as democracy , the rule of law , and less corruption Other such examples of a better lifestyle people living in such countries can experience are better transportation , electricity , and better access to water , compared to other developing countries Historical context The term came into use around 1970 , when the Four Asian Tigers of Taiwan , Singapore , Hong Kong and South Korea rose to global dominance in science , technological innovation and economic prosperity as well as NICs in the 1970s and 1980s , with exceptionally fast industrial growth since the 1960s all four countries having since graduated into high tech industrialized developed countries with wealthy high income economies There is a clear distinction between these countries and the countries now considered NICs In particular , the combination of an open political process , high GNI per capita , and a thriving , export oriented economic policy has shown that these East Asian economic tiger countries have now not only reached but surpassed the technological development of the developed countries in Western Europe , Canada , Japan , Australia , New Zealand and the United States All four countries are classified as high income economies by the World Bank and developed countries by the International Monetary Fund \( IMF \) and U S Central Intelligence Agency \( CIA \) All of the Four Asian Tigers , like Western European countries , have a Human Development Index considered very high by the United Nations Current The table below presents the list of countries consistently considered NICs by different authors and experts Turkey and South Africa are classified as developed countries by the CIA Turkey was a founding member of the OECD in 1961 and Mexico joined in 1994 The G8 5 group is composed of

join G14 Other Authors set lists of countries accordingly to different methods of economic analysis Sometimes a work ascribes NIC status to a country that other authors do n't consider a NIC This is the case of countries such as Argentina , Egypt , Sri Lanka and Russia Criticism NICs usually benefit from comparatively low wage costs , which translates into lower input prices for suppliers As a result , it is often easier for producers in NICs to outperform and outproduce factories in developed countries , where the cost of living is higher , and trade unions and other organizations have more political sway This comparative advantage is often criticized by advocates of the fair trade movement Critics of NICs argue economic freedom is not always associated with political freedom in countries such as China , pointing out that Internet censorship and human rights violations are common China Human Rights Amnesty International USA Amnestyusa org \( 2013 02 08 \) Retrieved on 2013 07
