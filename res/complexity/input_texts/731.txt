M ller Thurgau is a variety of white grape \( sp Vitis vinifera \) which was created by Hermann M ller from the Swiss Canton of Thurgau in 1882 It is used to make white wine in Germany , Austria , Northern Italy , England , in Australia , Czech Republic , New Zealand and Japan With around 42 , 000 hectares \( 104 , 000 acres \) cultivated world wide , M ller Thurgau is the most successful newly created varietal of the last 125 years Although plantings have decreased significantly since the 1980s , as of 2006 it was still Germany 's second most planted variety at 14 , 000 hectares and 13 7 of the total vineyard surface German Wine Institute German Wine Statistics 2007 2008 In 2007 the 125th anniversary was celebrated at the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute M ller Thurgau is also known as Rivaner \( Austria , Germany , Luxemburg , and especially for dry wines \) , Riesling x Sylvaner , Riesling Sylvaner \( Switzerland \) , Johannisberg \( Wallis caton in Switzerland \) and Rizlingszilv ni \( Hungary \) History of the grape variety Most grapes have been created from a desire to harness qualities in two separate grapes and to generate a new vine that combines the qualities of both When Dr M ller created the grape in the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in the late 19th century , his intention was to combine the intensity and complexity of the Riesling grape with the ability to ripen earlier in the season that the Silvaner grape possesses Although the resulting grape did not entirely attain these two qualities , it nonetheless became widely planted across many of the German wine producing regions thumb 300px Per cent share of common grape varieties in Germany 1964 2006 Note M ller Thurgau 's increase and decrease Data taken from German Wine Statistics

become Germany 's most planted grape A possible reason for the popularity of this varietal is that it is capable of being grown in a relatively wide range of climates and soil types Many of these vines were planted on flat areas that were not particularly suitable for growing other wine grapes because it was more profitable than sugar beet , which was the main alternative crop in those locations The vines mature early and bring large yield quantities M ller Thurgau wines are mild due to low acidic content , but nevertheless fruity The wines may be drunk while relatively young , and with few exceptions are not considered to improve with age These facts made M ller Thurgau an economical way to provide for the immense popularity of inexpensive , medium sweetness German wines such as Liebfraumilch and Piesporter The turning point in M ller Thurgau 's growth however was the winter of 1979 , when on 1st January there was a sharp fall in temperatures , to 20 F \( 4 C \) in many areas , which devastated most of the new varieties , but did not affect the varieties such as Riesling which have much more hardy stems , after hundreds of years of selection In the decades since then , the winemakers have begun to grow a wider variety of vines , and M ller Thurgau is now less widely planted in Germany than Riesling , although still significant in that country and world wide Genealogy Recent DNA fingerprinting has in fact determined that the grape was created by crossing Riesling with Madeleine RoyaleVitis International Variety Catalogue M ller Thurgau , accessed on May 26 , 2008 , not Silvaner or any other suggested grape variety But there has been some confusion on the way In 1996 Chasselas seemed to be a valid candidate , and in 1997 the Chasselas variety Admirable de Courtiller was specified However , this was shown to be wrong when the reference grape that was believed to be Admirable de Courtiller was proven in the year 2000 to be Madeleine Royale Dr Erika Dettweiler et al Grapevine cultivar M ller Thurgau and its true to type descent , Vitis 39 \( 2 \) , 63 65 , 2000 Madeleine Royale is now known to be a Chasselas seedling The consumer backlash against this grape , due to association with cheap , and by implication low quality wines , means that it is rarely declared on the label \( some winemakers call it Rivaner in Germany , others simply do not mention the grape variety \) Even Blue Nun Liebfraumilch is now made of 30 Riesling rather than entirely M ller Thurgau German Growing Regions As of 2006 , German regional

Italy , southern England \( where most other grapes will not ripen in many years \) Luxembourg \( where it is called Rivaner \) , Czech Republic , and the United States In Germany , it has long been common to blend M ller Thurgau with Bacchus , or small amounts of Morio Muscat to enhance its flavours Both are highly aromatic which do n't work very well in varietal wines on their own because of a
