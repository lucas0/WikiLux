Alexander Lvovich Parvus , born Israel Lazarevich Gelfand \( September 8 , 1867 December 12 , 1924 \) and sometimes called Helphand in the literature of the Russian Revolution , was a Marxist theoretician , revolutionary , and controversial activist in the Social Democratic Party of Germany Biography Early life Israel Lazarevich Gelfand was born to an ethnic Jewish family on September 8 , 1867 , in the shtetl of Berazino , Russian Empire , now part of Belarus Although little is known of Israel 's early childhood , the Gelfand family was of the lower middle class with his father working as an artisan of some sort perhaps as a locksmith or a blacksmith Z A B Zeman and W B Scharlau , The Merchant of Revolution The Life of Alexander Israel Helphand \( Parvus \) , 1867 1924 London Oxford

hometown of Israel 's paternal grandfather Zeman and Scharlau , The Merchant of Revolution , pg 9 Gelfand attended gymnasium in Odessa and received private tutoring in the humanities Zeman and Scharlau , The Merchant of Revolution , pg 10 He also read widely on his own , including material by the iconic Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko , the journalist Nikolai Mikhailovsky , and political satirist Mikhail Saltykov Shchedrin which led the young Gelfand to begin to question the legitimacy of the tsarist regime Zeman and Scharlau , The Merchant of Revolution , pp 10 11 Revolutionary In 1886 , the 19 year old Gelfand first traveled from Russia to Basel , Switzerland Zeman and Scharlau , The Merchant of Revolution , pp 11 and 16 It was there that Gelfand was first exposed to the writings of Alexander Herzen as well as the revolutionary literature of the day Zeman and Scharlau , The Merchant of Revolution , pg 12 He returned to Russia briefly the following year but he became the subject of official scrutiny by the tsarist secret police and was forced to leave the country again for his safety Zeman and Scharlau , The Merchant of Revolution , pg 14 He would remain abroad for more than a decade Returning to Switzerland , in the autumn of 1888 Gelfand enrolled at the University of Basel , where he studied political economy Zeman and Scharlau , The Merchant of Revolution , pg 16 Gelfand would remain at the university for the next three years , graduating with a doctorate degree in July 1891 Zeman and Scharlau , The Merchant of Revolution , pg 18 Gelfand 's professors were largely hostile to his Marxist approach to economics , however , and difficulty in his oral examination resulted in a rider being attached to the degree which rendered it the equivalent of a third class degree Gelfand chose not to pursue an academic career but rather sought to begin a political career which would both provide him financial support and serve the cause of socialism Zeman and Scharlau , The Merchant of Revolution , pg 19 Alienated from the backwardness of agrarian Russia and the limited political horizons there , Gelfand moved to Germany , joined the Social Democratic Party and befriended German revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg In 1900 , he met Vladimir Lenin for the first time , in Munich , each admiring the other 's theoretical works Parvus encouraged Lenin to begin publishing his revolutionary paper Iskra \( \) , Khronos , Accessed September 27 , 2009 Parvus' attempts to become a German citizen proved fruitless He once commented in a letter to his German friend

in the socialist press during the Russo Japanese War , found Parvus had predicted that Russia would lose the war , resulting in unrest and revolution When this proved to be the case , Parvus' prestige among his socialist and other German comrades increased Thus , German intelligence soon estimated he would be useful in efforts against the Russian Empire During this time he developed the concept of using a foreign war to provoke an internal revolt within a country It was at this time that Parvus revived , from Karl Marx , the concept strategy of permanent revolution He communicated this philosophy to Trotsky who then further expanded and developed it There were broad discussions on the questions of permanent revolution within the social democratic movement in the period leading up to 1917 The method was eventually adopted by Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks in Lenin 's April Theses in 1917 Russian Revolution of 1905 In 1905 , Parvus arrived in St Petersburg with false Austro Hungarian papers Parvus was regarded among European Marxists of the day as an authority on political and financial questions J L H Keep , The Rise of Social Democracy in Russia London Oxford University Press , 1963 pg 191 consequently when he authored a provocative article In December entitled The Financial Manifesto , which described the Russian economy as being on the verge of collapse it received broad play in the press In combination with this propaganda , Parvus coordinated an agitation of locals to feign a run on the banks As the news of the article and the subsequent rush was spread , the consequent hysteria managed to upset the economy and enrage prime minister Sergei Witte , but did not cause a financial collapse In connection with this provocation and Parvus' involvement in the organization of anti government actions during the 1905 revolution , Parvus \( together with other revolutionaries such as Leon Trotsky \) was arrested by the Russian police While in prison he became close with other revolutionaries , and was visited by Rosa Luxemburg Pietro Zveteremich , Il grande Parvus , Milan , Garzanti , 1988 , p 117 Sentenced to three years exile in Siberia , Parvus escaped and emigrated to Germany , where he published a book about his experiences called In the Russian Bastille during the Revolution right thumb A Parvus \( left \) with Leon Trotsky \( center \) and Leo Deutsch \( right \) in prison Maxim Gorky affair While in Germany , Parvus struck a deal with Russian author Maxim Gorky to produce his play The Lower Depths According to the agreement , the majority of the play 's proceeds were to go to the Russian Social Democratic Party \( and approximately 25 to Gorky himself \) Parvus' failure to pay \( despite the fact that the play had over 500 showings \) caused him to be accused of stealing 130 , 000 German gold marks Gorky threatened to sue , but Rosa Luxemburg convinced Gorky to keep the quarrel inside the party 's own court Eventually , Parvus paid back Gorky , but his reputation in party circles was damaged Istanbul period Soon afterwards Parvus moved to Istanbul in Ottoman Empire , where he lived for five years There he set up an arms trading company which profited handsomely during the Balkan War He became the financial and political advisor of the Young Turks In 1912 he was made editor of Turk Yurdu , their daily newspaper He worked closely with the triumvirs known as the Three Pashas Enver , Talat and Cemal and Finance Minister Djavid Bey His firm dealt with the deliveries of foodstuffs for the Ottoman army and he was a business partner of the Krupp concern , of Vickers Limited , and of the famous arms dealer Basil Zaharov Arms dealings with Vickers Limited at war time gave basis to the theory that Alexander Parvus was also a British intelligence asset Russian Revolution While in Turkey , Parvus became close with German ambassador Hans Freiherr von Wangenheim who was known to be partial to establishing revolutionary fifth columns among the allies Consequently , Parvus offered his plan via Baron von Wangenheim to the German General Staff the paralyzing of Russia via general strike , financed by the German government \( which , at the time , was at war with Russia and its allies \) Von Wangenheim sent Parvus to Berlin where the latter arrived on the 6 March 1915 and presented a 20 page plan titled A preparation of massive political strikes in Russia to the German government Parvus' detailed plan recommended the division of Russia by sponsoring the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party , encouraging ethnic separatists in various Russian regions , and supporting various writers whose criticism of Tsarism continued during wartime Basing himself on his 1905 experiences , Parvus theorised that the division of Russia and its loss in the First World War was the best way to bring about a socialist revolution Copenhagen operation Some accuse Parvus of having funded Lenin while in Switzerland Historians , however , are skeptical A biography of Parvus by the authors Scharlau and Zeman have concluded that there was no cooperation between the two It declared that Lenin refused the German offer of aid Parvus 's bank account shows that he only paid out a total of 25 , 600 francs in the period between his arrival in Switzerland in May 1915 and the February Revolution of 1917 Parvus did little in Switzerland , historians conclude Alfred Erich Senn , The Myth of German Money during the First World War , Soviet Studies , Vol XXVIII , No 1 , January 1976 , pp 83 90 Austrian intelligence through Parvus gave money to Russian emigre newspapers in Paris But when the sources of this funding became clear in the beginning of 1915 and more widely understood Lenin and the emigres in Paris rejected such support Harold Shukman has concluded , Funds were plainly not flowing into Lenin 's hands Harold Shukman , Lenin and the Russian Revolution , Putnam Pub Group , 1967 Parvus placed his bets on Lenin , as the latter was not only a radical but willing to accept the sponsorship of the Tsar 's wartime enemy , Germany The two met in Bern in May 1915 and agreed to collaboration through their organizations , though Lenin remained very careful never to get associated with Parvus in public There is no certain proof that they ever met face to face again , although there are indications that such a meeting may well have occurred on April 13 , 1917 , during Lenin 's stop over in Stockholm Hans Bj rkegren , Ryska posten de ryska revolution rerna i Norden 1906 1917 \( in Swedish \) , 1985 , Bonnier Fakta , Stockholm we know that Parvus sent a number of messages to Lenin that day and tried to coax a meeting , and some sources suggest that such an encounter did in fact happen before Lenin went north and home Parvus assiduously worked at keeping Lenin 's confidence , however Lenin kept him at arm 's length to disguise the changing roles of both men , Parvus involvement with German intelligence and his own liaisons with his old ally , who was not respected anymore among the socialists after his years in Turkey and after becoming a millionaire entrepreneur Michael Pearson , The Sealed Train , London , 1975 , ch 4 German intelligence set up Parvus' financial network via offshore operations in Copenhagen , setting up relays for German money to get to Russia via fake financial transactions between front organizations A large part of the transactions of these companies were genuine , but those served to bury the transfer of money to the Bolsheviks , a strategy made feasible by the weak and overburdened fiscal and customs offices in Scandinavia , which were inadequate for the booming black market in these countries during the war It is still debated whether the money with which this financial network operated was actually of German origin The evidence published by Alexander Kerensky 's Government in preparation for a trial scheduled for October \( November \) 1917 was recently reexamined and found to be either inconclusive or outright forgery Semion Lyandres The Bolsheviks' German Gold Revisited An Inquiry into the 1917 Accusations \( See also Sisson Documents \) However , setbacks occurred , as Yakov Ganetsky 's suspicious arms smuggling activities drew unwanted attention from the British Secret Intelligence Service who now traced Ganetsky to Parvus and hence to Baron von Wangenheim The Baron had long been under surveillance for his support of the Young Turks' revolutionary actions against the British As a result , Ganetsky was forced out of Denmark , while attempts were made by the British and Russians to stamp out the Bolshevik 's financial network in Turkey Additionally , as Lenin became more and more aware of Parvus' relations with German intelligence their relations became increasingly strained Losing the confidence and or control of his agents , Parvus began looking for other avenues of operation Parvus' reputation with the German ministry of foreign affairs came into question when in the winter of 1916 a Parvus planned financial catastrophe in St Petersburg \( akin to Parvus' provocation against the Russian banks in 1905 \) failed to produce a massive uprising As a result , financing for Parvus' operations were frozen Parvus went for support to the German Navy , briefly working as their advisor He managed to help prevent Russian naval Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak from taking on his offensive against the Turko German Fleet in the Bosphorus and Dardanelles by planning the sabotage of a major Russian warship This success gave him more credibility , once again , in the eyes of the Germans In April 1917 , in a plan strategized together with Parvus , German intelligence allowed Vladimir Lenin and a group of 30 of his revolutionary associates , in exile in Switzerland , to travel back to Russia through Germany and Sweden and Finland , in a train car under supervision of Swiss socialist Fritz Platten Lenin famously disembarked from the train at the Finland Station in St Petersburg Leon Trotsky responded to allegations that Lenin had colluded with German

with the Imperial Government became known , the revelations ruined relations with the rest of the revolutionary network including Rosa Luxemburg and other German socialists who were engaging in the subversion of the German Empire Despite evidence showing that Parvus had never betrayed German socialists to the authorities , his credibility among the revolutionary elite went sour As his political activity waned , the war ground to a halt , and he refused to help the new German authorities smash the Spartacist uprising , retreating to a German island near Berlin Despite his failure to help the new Weimar Republic regime he was well provided for , living in a well appointed 32 room mansion in Berlin 's Peacock Island He later published his memoirs from this residence Death Parvus died in

International Haenisch , Konrad Parvus ein Blatt der Erinnerung Berlin Verl f r Sozialwissenschaft , 1925 During his lifetime , Alexander Parvus' reputation among his revolutionary peers suffered as a result of the Maxim Gorky affair \( see above \) and the fact that he was in effect a German government agent At the same time both his business skills and revolutionary ideas were appreciated and relied upon by Russian and German revolutionaries and Ottoman 's Young Turks After the October Revolution in Russia for obvious political reasons his role was denied and he himself vilified This continued during Joseph Stalin 's era and sometimes had anti semitic overtones to it In Germany however he was considered favorably His name is often used in modern political debates in Russia Parvus has left no documents after his death and all of his savings disappeared Both of his surviving sons became Soviet diplomats Stephen F Cohen in the introduction to Anna Larina 's book This I Cannot Forget mentions the son of Parvus , Yevgeny Aleksandrovich Gnedin Gnedin was a Soviet journalist and a diplomat , who in his memoirs Catastrophe and Rebirth and in Exit from the Labyrinth described many years of Stalinist camps and exile Media He was portrayed by British actor Michael Gough in the 1974 BBC mini series Fall of Eagles covering the history of the pre World War I period Footnotes
