The 1957 Georgia Memorial to Congress is a joint resolution by the legislature of the state of Georgia , and approved by the Governor on March 8 , 1957 , urging the Congress of the United States to

ratified the invalid proposals That the pretended ratification of the 14th and 15th amendments was necessary to give color to the claim that these so called amendments had been ratified by three fourths of the states That the mere lapse of time does not confirm an invalidly enacted provision That the continued recognition of the 14th and 15th amendments is incompatible with the present day position of the United States as the World 's champion of Constitutional governments resting upon the consent of the people given through their lawful representatives The events described in the memorial have been the subject of editorials in the Chattanooga Free PressMarch 8 , 1995 and in U S News World Report September 27 , 1957 , page 140 et seq The Chattanooga Free Press editorial by the paper 's staff also contends that the petition 's purported facts are unrefuted , and that , after fifty years , no contradictory response to the Georgia resolution has been received from the Congress of the United States or other government officials Copies were reportedly transmitted to the President of the United States , the Chief Justice of the United States , the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives of Congress of the United States , and the Senators and Representatives in Congress from the State of Georgia Nevertheless , the consensus among legal scholars , including the Supreme Court , is that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments are valid Notes External links Text of the Memorial Photocopy of Chattanooga Free Press Editorial page , March 8 , 1995
