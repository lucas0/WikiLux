pioneer of a new style of Sudanese singing because he used a style of poetry labelled by many critics as sophisticated and complicated , and one categorized as political singing At the start of Mustafa 's career , he collaborated with many traditional singers , writers and poets , but disagreements arose with some of the poets he had been collaborating with For example , he had a disagreement with one of the poets who wrote the song Shagga Alayaam \( English The suffering of the days \) , and the argument led to a dispute with the entire Sudanese Union for Singing and Music

Fadullah , Abu zar Al gafari , Muhammad Elmahdi Abed Elwahab , Qasim Abu zid , Katab Hassan Ahmad , Salaah haj Seed Later , in the late 1980s and 1990s , Mustafa collaborated with more poets ,
