The Reagan coalition included a relatively small but highly influential group of wealthy Americans associated with the corporate and financial world the kind of people who had dominated American poliics and government through much of the nation s history until the New Deal began to challenge their preeminence What united this group was a firm commitment to capitalism and to unfettered economic growth a belief that the market offers the best solutions to most problems a deep hostility to most government interference in markets and a belief that most of what is valuable in American lie depends on the health and strength of the corporate world , and thus that the corporate world is entitled to a special position of influence and privilege in society Central to this group s agenda in the 1980s was opposition to what is considered redistributive politics of the federal government \( and especially its highly progressive tax structure \) and hostility to the rise of what they believed were antibusiness government regulations Reagan courted these free market conservatives carefully and effectively , and in the end it was their interests his administration most effectively served
