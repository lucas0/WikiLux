Banca Unione \( formerly Banca Feltrinelli \) was controlled by Giangiacomo until 1968 , when it was taken over by Michele Sindona According to some interpretations Sindona was pushed to buy out

Feltrinelli Editore Its first published book was the autobiography of the first Indian Prime Minister , Jawaharlal Nehru Dr Zhivago In late 1956 an Italian journalist showed Feltrinelli the manuscript of Doctor Zhivago by the Russian writer Boris Pasternak Set in Russia , the novel follows a multitude of characters from 1903 to 1943 , the period of revolution , bloody civil war , Leninism , Stalinism , and the early part of the Second World War Feltrinelli 's Slavist advisor told him , Not to publish a novel like this would constitute a crime against culture His son Carlo 's biography of Feltrinelli records the fascinating correspondence between him and Pasternak , as they successfully resisted clumsy attempts by the Soviet regime to halt publication of the novel The complete Pasternak Feltrinelli correspondence mostly intercepted at the time by the KGB is given in Doctor Zhivago immediately became an international best seller Feltrinelli rushed the Italian translation of

communist leadership in Moscow , which had not wanted the book published , Feltrinelli was criticised , and he decided not to renew his party membership in 1957 , though he kept on good terms with the PCI But the PCI leaders were reluctant to be seen to condone criticism of the Soviet Union The Leopard Feltrinelli Editore scored another coup in 1958 when it published a book rejected by every other significant Italian publisher The Leopard by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa Described by some as the greatest novel of the century , The Leopard centres on the Sicilian nobility during the Risorgimento of the mid 19th century , when the Italian middle class rose violently and formed a united Italy under Giuseppe Garibaldi and the House of Savoy Despite these successes , Feltrinelli Editore in this period lost about 400 million lire a year on a turnover of 1 207 billion lire , because Feltrinelli believed in keeping his prices low for maximum readership access Still , Feltrinelli Libra \( a chain of bookstores \) had a nominal capital of 120 million in 1956 Feltrinelli Masonite , which he chaired , had a turnover of 1 421 billion in 1965 Another firm which he advised on real estate construction had a capital of 400 million in 1970 So ample funds were available from his other investments Whatever his own reading tastes , Feltrinelli was always keen to promote the avant garde , including the works of the influential literary circle , Group 63 He also took the risk of publishing and distributing novels banned under obscenity laws , such as Henry Miller 's Tropic of Cancer Starting in Pisa in 1957 , Feltrinelli built up a chain of retail outlets which after his death became the largest in Italy it had over a hundred bookshops In 1960 Feltrinelli married the German photographer , Inge Sch nthal , and they had a son and heir , Carlo Inge eventually became the de facto head of the publishing house as Giangiacomo came to devote himself to clandestine political activity , of which she disapproved Mother and son still run Feltrinelli Editore together Activism In the post war period Feltrinelli had joined the Italian Socialist Party \( PSI \) before moving to the Italian Communist Party \( PCI \) , which he left in 1957 Cuba , Bolivia Feltrinelli spent the Sixties travelling the world and making links with various radical Third World leaders and guerrilla

On the relationship between Feltrinelli and Sardianian separatism see Feltrinelli increasingly advocated guerrilla activity in Italy on behalf of the working class \( His sometime stepfather Luigi Barzini thought Giangiacomo preferred the company of men who despised the masses as he did , who thought them something they could play with \) In 1970 , fearing a right wing coup , Feltrinelli founded the militant Gruppi di Azione Partigiana \( Partisan Action Groups , GAP \) GAP would become the second militant organization after the Red Brigades to be formed during the Years of Lead

pylon of a high voltage power line at Segrate , near Milan , apparently killed by his own explosives while on an operation with other GAP members Some 8 , 000 people attended Feltrinelli 's funeral His death , like his father 's 37 years before , was immediately viewed suspiciously , but Luigi Barzini had considered and rejected the possibility of it having been a killing at the time of Feltrinelli 's death Yet is it very likely that a conspirator with the gifts of a great novelist or a great film director was to be found among the secret agents \? a plotter capable of staging a death so faithful to the victim his past , his nature and his character \? In 1974 an audio recording found in a shelter of the Red Brigades described Feltrinelli as sitting astride the pylon preparing the dynamite At that time the first accomplice , half way up the pylon , felt a strong and dry explosion but clung tightly to the pillar He fell to the ground , looked upward and saw nothing , looked down and saw Osvaldo Feltrinelli rolling on the ground His immediate impression was that Osvaldo had lost both his legs In 1979 , during an anti terrorist trial , the Red Brigades defendants read into the court record a signed statement that Feltrinelli was engaged in an operation to sabotage electricity pylons intended to cause a blackout in a wide area of Milan It was a technical error committed by him which led to the fatal accident and the subsequent failure of the whole operation Original text \( Italian \) Osvaldo non una vittima , ma un rivoluzionario caduto combattendo Egli era impegnato in un'operazione di sabotaggio di tralicci dell'alta tensione che doveva provocare un black out in una vasta zona di Milano al fine di garantire una migliore operativit a nuclei impegnati nell'attacco a diversi obiettivi Fu un errore tecnico da lui stesso commesso , e cio la scelta di utilizzare orologi di bassa affidabilit trasformati in timers , sottovalutando gli inconvenienti di sicurezza , a determinare l'incidente mortale e il conseguente fallimento di tutta l'operazione The defendants denied the thesis of the murder , claiming it was a commemoration of the publisher and his political ideas , and a critique addressed to the circles of the extra parliamentary left who had tried to deny themLuciano Gulli , Il giudizio dei terroristi su Feltrinelli Un rivoluzionario caduto combattendo , il Giornale nuovo , April 1 , 1979 They also admitted that Feltrinelli was not obsessed with a neo fascist coup , because he wanted to establish in Italy the armed struggle and was one of the first to have had contacts with the German Red Army Faction finally they affirmed that the relationships between GAP and RB were characterized by the maximum correctness , without competitive spirit The trial ended with 11 convictions , 7 acquittals , 2 prescriptions and 9 amnestiesGi presentato l'appello per Lazagna e altri sette , il Giornale nuovo , April 3 , 1979 \( this legal sentence was largely confirmed in 1981 \) Trentaquattro anni di carcere per Curcio e altri 8 brigatisti , il Giornale nuovo , April 10 , 1981 In cultural memory Senior Service , by Carlo Feltrinelli , 2001 This lengthy biography , written by his Giangiacomo 's son Carlo , was first published in Italian , and then translated into English Feltrinelli , an 80 minute documentary by Alessandro Rossetto , was released in 2006 Feltrinelli , played by Fabrizio Parenti , appears in the 2012 film Piazza Fontana The Italian Conspiracy \( Romanzo di una strage \) by Marco Tullio Giordana The film is about the 1969 bomb explosion in Milan 's Piazza Fontana , the subsequent fall to his death from a police window of an anarchist suspect , and the putative murder of Luigi Calabresi , the investigating police commissioner In the film he takes part personally in the discovery of Feltrinelli 's body Calabresi in reality directed the investigation from Milan Feltrinelli 's life story was the subject of the 2013 concept album and theatrical performance Praxis Makes Perfect by the group Neon Neon Feltrinelli , his publishing , and his suspicious death are mentioned several times in The Flamethrowers , a novel by Rachel Kushner which is set during the Years of Lead See also List of unsolved deaths References Further reading Gottfried Abrath , Der AugenBlick , historischer Tatsachenroman , Norderstedt 2015 , ISBN 9 783734 746758 The American edition of Senior Service in the references Knigge , Jobst C \( 2010 \) Feltrinelli Sein Weg in den Terrorismus , Humboldt University , Berlin Category 1926 births Category 1972 deaths Category Italian book publishers \( people \) Category Italian communists Category Deaths related to the Years of Lead \( Italy \) Category People from Milan Category Italian publishers \( people \) Category Deaths by improvised explosive device Category Unsolved deaths
