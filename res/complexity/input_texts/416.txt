Deus Ex is a computer game developed by Ion Storm Inc and published by Eidos Interactive It was released in 2000 and had cyberpunk story and setting elements Set in a dystopian world during the year 2052 , the game combines the action elements of a first person shooter with the character development and interaction of a role playing game Overview The game 's name is derived from the Latin expression deus ex machina , literally meaning god from the machine , i e a person or event that provides a sudden , unexpected solution to a story These most obviously refer to the game 's protagonist JC Denton and the cybernetic themes of the game Also , Warren Spector \( producer of System Shock \) , one of the game 's designers , has stated the name was a dig at the typical video game plot , which tends to be laden with deus ex machina artifices and other poor script writing techniques The game is built based on a modified Unreal engine and Deus Ex is seen as combining a variety of gaming genres The game featured environments often drawn from real locations It was also notable for the complex tactical possibilities , where players could choose many different ways of achieving evolving goals , including stealth \( akin to Thief \) , long range sniping , all out combat with various heavy weapons , character interaction , bypassing devices , computer hacking and use of objects in the environment This level of freedom required levels , characters and puzzles to be designed with an enormous level of redundancy a single play through of the game will miss hundreds of lines of dialogue , alternate routes and large sections of the environment For this reason few games have managed or even tried to create a similar experience Its uniquely liberal nature and emergent gameplay have earned it a large cult following who see it as a first step into a new level of interactive experience Deus Ex 's plot drew together several current conspiracy theories into a narrative with characters having a deeper development than those of most FPS games It also presented a philosophical dilemma in its conclusion where the player is given a world altering choice , of which none of the options are broadcast in game as the right choice The game 's level of detail astounded the gaming world As an example , one of Deus Ex 's central topics is nanotechnology , the main character JC Denton is augmented by symbiotic microscopic machines called nanites and the game contains an impressive amount of literature on nanotechnology and defines its science quite accurately Many allusions to classic literature and influences \( predominantly Neal Stephenson 's The Diamond Age and Snow Crash , as well as G K Chesterton 's The Man Who Was Thursday \) can be found throughout the game environment These details encourage the player to replay the game to discover and learn more about the world of Deus Ex The game was hailed by many critics and users as a significant step towards a reality simulation , as one of the first games to truly pioneer the effect of moral choices , and one of the only games in existence based on violence to offer a non violent alternative killing is not a necessary part of Deus Ex The game did not originally ship with multiplayer support Later versions provided multiplayer , as well as various game fixes Deus Ex Game of the Year Edition , as well as containing all current game updates and a Software development kit , included a separate soundtrack CD and a mock up newspaper page on recent events in the game 's world However , some distributions of the GOTY version do not include the soundtrack CD , and only have a PDF version of the newspaper page A version was also released for the PlayStation 2 , named Deus Ex The Conspiracy , was released on March 25 , 2002 , featuring improved character graphics and motion captured models Some levels were changed and chopped down into smaller hubs due to the PS2 's memory limitations A sequel , Deus Ex Invisible War , was released in the United States on December 3 , 2003 , and then in Europe in early 2004 for both the PC and the X Box Plans for a Deus Ex movie were in the works , however the film is now listed on IMDb as cancelled Despite its age and the release of Deus Ex Invisible War the Deus Ex community is still very active There are a significant number of websites which offer news , information , and resources to Deus Ex players old and new alike Several groups of fans have also created and released modifications for Deus Ex , including The Cassandra Project , Zodiac , RedSun 2020 , and Hotel Carone , which offer new plots , characters , weapons and more Other modifications are still in development , such as The Nameless Mod , Deus Ex 2027 , UNATCO Born , Chronos and The Novosibirsk Conspiracy , and are expected to release sometime in the near future There are also various attempts by fans of the game to update the graphics using new higher resolution textures and models The two most influential projects are called Project HDTP and DeusEx Reborn Deus Ex and 9 11 The game attracted attention after the September 11 , 2001 attacks in New York The World Trade Center towers are absent from the New York skyline in the game This was to cut down on memory requirements for the first map , Liberty Island The reason that the developers gave , when asked , was that they had been destroyed by terrorists This was over a year before the real attacks occurred , and the war on terror was declared Similarly , a central concept to the game is that of a war on terror in the game world , after the destruction of the Trade Centers , the Statue of Liberty was also bombed , after which the United Nations Anti Terrorist Coalition or UNATCO was founded , which is remarkably similar in form and function to the Coalition of Nations sent to Iraq to depose Saddam Hussein and find terrorists In the game , UNATCO has evolved from a so called peacekeeping organization into an oppressive world police force , and as this development was described in the game , it is unnervingly similar to the Iraqi Coalition 's gradual evolution from a military invasion force to a sort of foreign police , attempting to manipulate Iraqi politics to follow directions favourable to its founders This and many other seemingly prophetic game features have made Deus Ex controversial after its release In addition , the aftermath of 9 11 resulted in FEMA assuming an anti terror role , much like the seemingly omnipotent FEMA of Deus Ex CharactersMain article Deus Ex
