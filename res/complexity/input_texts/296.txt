Rajiv Gandhi proposed to alleviate communal violence and retain Muslim votes Claimed by the government to be a reinforcement of India 's constitutional secularism , it was widely criticised by both Muslims and Hindus The liberals among them , says Ainslie Embree , saw it as a capitulation to the forces of Islamic obscurantism , a return to the thirteenth century the Hindu revivalist critics thought it was weakening Indian unity Shourie wrote articles that tried to show that the treatment of women as required by the Quran would in fact offer them protection , although the application of Islamic law in practice was oppressing them He was in turn criticised for what was perceived as a thinly veiled attack on Islam itself , with Rafiq Zakaria , the Muslim scholar , saying that Shourie 's concern for reform of Islam was in fact demonstrative of Hindu contempt that used the plight of Muslim women as an example of the backwardness of the community Vir Sanghvi termed it Hindu chauvinism with a liberal face After the defeat of the BJP in 2009 general elections , Shourie asked for introspection and accountability within the party He deplored factionalism within the party and

voiced support for the aims of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh \( RSS \) , a nationalist Hindutva organisation This has caused unease among some of those who admire his journalism He has said that , although he sees a danger from perceived Muslim violence such as the Godhra train burning incident of 2002 , people have tended to redefine the Hindutva term He says that prominent members of the Bharatiya Janata Party \( BJP \) , of which he is a member and which has ties to the RSS specifically , L K Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee have shown their opposition to sectarian hatred and in their attempts to make the BJP inclusive have tried to marginalise those on both the Muslim and Hindu extremes who promote such hatred As a political scientist he views that current leaders lack competency
