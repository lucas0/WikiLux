with Katyusha rockets Israel continued to bomb Lebanon 's infrastructures Shelling of UN compound By 14 April , 745 people were occupying the United Nations compound at Qana More than 800 were there on April 18 Beginning with the second day of combat Israel had been retaliating within 10 minutes directly at any source of fire discovered by reconnaissance This tactic was widely discussed in Israeli media , and well known to the Hezbollah fighters and Lebanese citizens According to a U N report , on April 18 , Hezbollah fighters fired two or three Katyusha rockets and between five and eight mortars at Israeli soldiers near the Red Line \( the northern limits of the security zone \) from positions about 220 meters southwest and 350 meters southeast of the United Nations compound 15 minutes later an Israeli unit responded by shelling the area with M 109A2 155 mm guns According to the Israeli military , 38 shells were fired , two thirds of them equipped with proximity fuses , an anti personnel mechanism that causes the weapon to explode above the ground As a result of the shelling , 106 civilians died , with more wounded Israeli response 250px thumb right UN Troops assemble victims of the shelling \( This image is from an edited video supplied by Al Manar TV in Beirut , April , 1996 \) Israel immediately expressed regret for the loss of innocent lives , saying that the Hezbollah position and not the UN compound was the intended target of the shelling , and that the compound was hit due to incorrect targeting based on erroneous data Army Deputy Chief of Staff , Matan Vilnai stated that the shells hit the base not because they were off target , but because Israeli gunners used outdated maps of the area He also stated that the gunners miscalculated the firing range of the shells Prime Minister Shimon Peres said , We did not know that several hundred people were concentrated in that camp It came to us as a bitter surprise Serge Schmemann , Voicing Regret ,

peacekeepers remove the remains of artillery attack victims The UN appointed military advisor Major General Franklin van Kappen of the Netherlands to investigate the incident His conclusions were \( a \) The distribution of impacts at Qana shows two distinct concentrations , whose mean points of impact are about 140 metres apart If the guns were converged , as stated by the Israeli forces , there should have been only one main point of impact \( b \) The pattern of impacts is inconsistent with a normal overshooting of the declared target \( the mortar site \) by a few rounds , as suggested by the Israeli forces \( c \) During the shelling , there was a perceptible shift in the weight of fire from the mortar site to the United Nations compound \( d \) The distribution of point impact detonations and air bursts makes it improbable that impact fuses and proximity fuses were employed in random order , as stated by the Israeli forces \( e \) There were no impacts in the second target area which the Israeli forces claim to have shelled \( f \) Contrary to repeated denials , two Israeli helicopters and a remotely piloted vehicle were present in the Qana area at the time of the shelling While the possibility cannot be ruled out completely , it is unlikely that the shelling of the United Nations compound was the result of gross technical and or procedural errors Israel 's response to the report Israel issued the following response to the UN report 1 Israel categorically rejects the findings of the UN report concerning the incident at Kana 2 Israel profoundly regrets the loss of human life at Kana and has thoroughly investigated this tragic incident which was caused , first and foremost , by the firing of Katyusha rockets and mortars by Hizbullah from a location in close proximity to the UN position We reiterate that the IDF had no intention whatsoever of firing on the UN position at Kana Our investigation has shown that the UN position was hit by artillery fire due to incorrect targeting based on erroneous data The IAF drone shown on videotape did not reach the area until after the UN position was hit and was not an operational component in the targeting of Israeli artillery fire in the area 3 It is difficult to understand and highly regrettable that this report does not condemn Hizbullah for the cynical use of civilians as a shield for its gunmen , nor does it continue any condemnation of Hizbullah 's use of areas contiguous or in close proximity to UN positions for launching attacks upon Israel 4 This inaccurate and one sided report is misleading , runs contrary to the stated desire of the UN to play a more active role in the Middle East peace process and undermines its ability to do so Israel hopes that the understanding reached between the various sides will engender the calm and stability necessary to engage the parties concerned in peace negotiations which are the only way to promote peace and security between Israel and Lebanon Amnesty International report Amnesty International conducted an on site investigation of the incident in collaboration with military experts , using interviews with UNIFIL staff and civilians in the compound , and posing questions to the IDF , who did not reply Amnesty concluded , the IDF intentionally attacked the UN compound , although the motives for doing so remain unclear The IDF have failed to substantiate their claim that the attack was a mistake Even if they were to do so they would still bear responsibility for killing so many civilians by taking the risk to launch an attack so close to the UN compound http www amnesty org en library asset MDE15 042 1996 en dbadaf6a eaf6 11dd aad1 ed57e7e5470b mde150421996en pdf Amnesty International could not establish with certainty whether or not the IDF knew that Lebanese civilians were sheltering in the compound when it was attacked However , Israel knew that UN positions are not legitimate targets and fact that the attack proceeded indicated a callous disregard for civilian lives and a breach of the laws of war on directly or indiscriminately targeting civilians Amnesty International said it was also clear that Hizbullah fired a mortar from a position within 200 metres of the periphery of the UN compound All indications were that they were firing at an IDF patrol who had infiltrated north of the security zone and had apparently been laying mines The intention of Hizbullah in choosing that location for the mortar was unclear it might have been to shield themselves against an IDF counter attack in the belief that the UN compound would be too close for the IDF to respond Even if this was not the intention of Hizbullah , by taking up positions where they did they clearly were reckless as to the consequences this might have for the civilians in the immediate area In either case , this was a clear breach of the laws of war prohibiting the use of civilian population as a shield View of Human Rights Watch Human Rights Watch concurred , The decision of those who planned the attack to choose a mix of high explosive artillery shells that included deadly anti personnel shells designed to maximize injuries on the ground and the sustained firing of such shells , without warning , in close proximity to a large concentration of civilians violated a key principle of international humanitarian law UN General Assembly vote In a 66 to 2 vote \( 59 abstentions , United States and Israel voting against \) the United Nations General Assembly decided that the 1 7million cost of repairs to the UNIFIL headquarters should be paid for by Israel Votes to reaffirm the resolution that Israel should pay the costs of damage appeared before the General Assembly every year until 2003 with the same pattern one third for , one third abstaining , two \( United States and Israel \) against The United States claims that financial resolutions , such as this , had to be adopted by consensus to apply , and Israel arguing that the battalion headquarter should be relocated elsewhere , and they were bound by no legal or moral obligation to assume responsibility for damage caused by their retaliation against terrorists Lawsuit by relatives On December 15 , 2005 , relatives of the victims filed suit in a Washington , DC court against former IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Yaalon for his role in the deaths The lawsuit was prepared by the Center for Constitutional Rights Yaalon , who was a visiting scholar in Washington , reportedly refused the papers serving the lawsuit Among the plaintiffs named in the lawsuit are Saadallah Ali Belhas and his son Ali Belhas , who lost 31 family members in the raid , including their respective wives and 12 children The United States District
