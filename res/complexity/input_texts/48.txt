George A Bonanno \( \) is a professor of clinical psychology at Teachers College , Columbia University , U S A He is responsible for introducing the controversial idea of resilience to the study of loss and trauma He is known as a pioneering researcher in the field of bereavement and trauma Susan Nolen Hoeksema , Professor of Psychology , Yale University , Bonanno has revolutionized our thinking about how people respond to loss and trauma The Other Side of Sadness has tremendous implications for interventions and for how people see themselves Daniel Gilbert , Professor of Psychology , Harvard University author of Stumbling on Happiness , There are a lot of books on bereavement and now you can throw them all away Bonanno carefully assembles scientific evidence to show that most of what we thought we knew is just plain wrong http www tc columbia edu faculty index htm \? facid gab38 George A Bonanno 's Columbia University Faculty Page The New York Times on February 15 , 2011 , stated that the current science of bereavement has been driven primarily by Bonanno Scientific American summarized a main finding of his work , The ability to rebound remains the norm throughout adult life Contributions to the field Bonanno 's contributions to the field , summarized in his book , The Other Side of Sadness What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us About Life After a Loss , include the following The idea that resilience is the most common , natural reaction to loss or trauma Introducing rigorous scientific methods of research to the field of bereavement and trauma Describing for the first time a natural resilience as the main component of grief and trauma reactions in people who face major losses , such as the death of a spouse , the loss of a child , having suffered sexual abuse as a child , or losing a loved one in severe stressor events , such as the September 11 World Trade Center attacks Replacing with scientific findings the major concepts of grief that are theoretical , unsupported scientifically , but remain popular among practitioners and the lay public today , such as K bler Ross model of the stages of grief and the idea of grief work based on Freud 's ideas http www boston com news globe health science articles 2006 01 09 some comfort for the grieving theres no wrong way to do it Boston Globe Business Day Article Some comfort for the grieving There 's no wrong way to do it Demonstrating scientifically that some practices common in grief counseling , trauma counseling , and among therapists after potentially traumatic events can be harmful These practices include asking people to talk about a loss or to cry about a loss These practices are common parts of public policy and are based on the underlying assumption that people are not resilient Showing that genuine laughter and smiling is a healthy response to a loss or stressor event is protective The first and only researcher having obtained and used pre loss data to understand the processes of grief Based on pre loss data , outlining four trajectories of grief Demonstrating that absence of grief or trauma symptoms is a healthy outcome , rather than something to be feared as has been the thought and practice until his research Coining the phrase coping ugly to describe the idea that coping with grief takes many forms , some of which seem counter intuitive Because resilience is natural , suggesting that it cannot be taught through specialized programs and that there is virtually no existing research to design resilience training nor is there existing research to support major investment in such things as military resilience training programs Resilience Bonanno 's research found psychological resilience to be at the core of human grief and trauma reactions Bonanno 's finding of resilience overturns what has been the status quo assumption of a person 's experience of grief and trauma in the West since Sigmund Freud nearly a century ago Bonanno 's contribution to the field is to have found resilience through rigorous research and not through anecdotal evidence , theorizing , or simple but unreliable methodology Many in the field of bereavement have found Bonanno 's finding of persistent resilience in the face of potentially traumatic events controversial Many therapists and psychiatrists , who tend to treat the chronically affected , find it hard to imagine that no treatment is needed for most people who have experienced a loss or even an extreme stressor event , such as during 9 11 or childhood sexual abuse Further , in contrast to Freud 's and his followers' ideas and prevailing popular theories , it is difficult for many people to accept laughter as a healthy response Another difficult concept , especially in the face a potentially traumatic event when people feel pulled to help in some way , is to realize that offering treatment to otherwise well people can cause harm , by producing the symptoms they hope to avoid Other critics have claimed the opposite , that far from being misguided , the idea that humans are resilient is so obvious that it is simplistic Others have countered that it may seem simple , but the idea has escaped researchers for the century between Freud 's work and Bonanno 's Policy and treatment for the past century has relied on the false idea that humans are not resilient , a costly mistake in human and monetary terms That people are resilient even when facing extreme stressors or losses contradicts the stages model of grief Many resilient people show no grief They therefore have no stages of grief to pass through Until Bonanno , therapists and psychiatrists considered the absence of grief a pathology to be feared , rather than a healthy outcome http health discovery com centers mental articles qa bonnano html Resilience has profound implications for people 's concepts of themselves , especially after suffering a severe stressor event The idea also has important implication for how the therapeutic community thinks of bereavement and treats bereavement Bonanno 's research has shown that universal counseling by grief counselors after potentially traumatic events does more harm than good Resilience being an inherent part of human experience after major stressor events also may have important implications for public policy , such as how to best treat veterans who have served in war situations and whether to counsel large populations after major stressor events , such as tsunamis or mass shootings Four trajectories of grief and trauma reactions In 2002 and 2004 , Bonanno

id 5893 Press Release by Teachers College , Columbia University The fields of bereavement and trauma research rely often on simple measures , such as self report questionnaires Self report measures are simple and inexpensive to give , but are unreliable for several reasons Of concern to the fields of grief and trauma , self report measures are biased by how the subject feels at the moment he or she answers the questionnaire If the subject feels bad at the time of answering the questionnaire , the subject will remember the loss as more devastating If the subject feels good when taking the questionnaire , the subject will report that the loss was less difficult to endure This subjectivity can change rapidly Recognizing that any single simple measure cannot be accurate , one hallmark of Bonanno 's research methodology has relied on several independent measures simultaneously This ensures convergent validity of any findings For example , his research studies often simultaneously use , among other measures , skin temperature , heart rate , the Facial Action Coding System or FACS pioneered by Paul Ekman , empty chair studies , longitudinal measures over months or years , cortisol , physician and friend reports , and Stroop tests In addition , he is known for developing new research techniques , such as a measure of ambivalence and the empty chair study with researcher Nigel Field Criticism James W Pennebaker 's findings , very well supported by data , directly contradict Bonanno 's claims on the harmful effects of retrieving bad experiences One possible explanation and attempt to reconcile this seeming contradiction is the method for retrieving or reviewing bad memories Pennabaker is known for his pioneering work in writing therapy It may be that there 's something about writing , rather than expressively crying in public , for one example , that helps rather than hurts a person 's outcome Writing may help preserve social bonds , which are crucial to maintain for good outcomes after a loss Personal life George Bonanno lives in New York , NY with his wife , Paulette Roberts , and their two children References External links Good Grief ! by Emily Nussbaum \( Lingua Franca article \) Catastrophic loss , and the resilience of the human psyche \( article on Japan earthquake , tsunami , nuclear disasters \) Scientific American article The Neuroscience of True Grit Time Magazine article New Ways to Think About Grief New York Times article Resilience , Not Misery , in Coping with Death New York Times op ed piece Grief , Unedited New York Times Magazine article Repress Yourself The New Yorker Article by Malcolm Gladwell Getting Over It Project Rebirth Video Using Project Rebirth in a Clinical Psychology Course on Loss and Trauma Video George Bonanno on the Value of Grief and Grieving New York Times Personal Health Column article by Jane Brody Often , Time Beats Therapy for Treating Grief New York Times Science Page Article After a Death , the Pain That Doesn t Go Away Bonanno 's Four Trajectories of Grief in New York Times Week in Review Down and Out or Up Psychology Today Can Therapy Make You Worse \?
