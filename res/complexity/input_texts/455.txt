temple The celebration attracts pilgrims and tourists from all parts of India and across the world A Brahmotsavam is a holy cleansing ceremony in honor of Lord Brahma , and the one at Tirumala is by far the largest Etymology The word Brahmotsavam is a combination of two Sanskrit words Brahma and Utsavam In one context , it is said that Lord Brahma first performed this festival and hence Brahmotsavam is referred to as Festival celebrated by Brahma , where Brahma refers to Lord Brahma and Utsavam means Festival In other context , the word Brahma refers to Grand or Huge and hence referred to Grand Festival Srivari Brahmotsavams is also called by other names Venkateswara Salakatla Brahmotsavams , Venkateswara Navaratri Brahmotsavams Two Brahmotsavam in Adhika Maas Year When there is Adhika Maasa \( extra Month \) in the Lunar Calendar , 2 Brahmotsavam will be held viz , Salakatla Annual Brahmotsavam Navarathri Brahmotsavam Both Brahmotsavam will be held for 9 days In 2015 , 2018 there was is Adhika Maas , hence 2 Brahmotsavam were will be held There are few differences between the 2 Brahmotsavam During Salakatla Brahmotsavam , there will Flag hoisting Dwajarohanam

Flag unhoisting \( Dwajaavarohanam \) on 9th day evening whereas in Navaratri Brahmotsavam there will be no Flag unhoisting \( since No Flag was hoisted \) , Instead Lord Venkateshwara will bless in Golden Tiruchi Vahanam Legend As per the legend it is believed that Lord Brahma will descend to the earth to conduct this festival and hence the festival got the name Brahmotsavams , meaning an utsavam \( festival \) performed by Brahma Sri Venkteswara Sahasranamastotra has references to Brahma performing the festival To resemble this even now the a small empty wooden chariot known as
