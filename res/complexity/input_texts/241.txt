March 31 , 2016 It serves as a replacement for as a lower cost entry in the iPhone product line combining the updated processor , rear camera , and other features from the high end with the smaller 4 inch display and nearly identical styling to the , the only differences being the available colors \( similar to the iPhone 6S models \) and the matte chamfered edges The iPhone SE is available in silver , space gray , gold , and rose gold finishes , and are priced at for and for in the United States Market positioning The last major redesign of iPhone , the 4 7 5 5 inch iPhone 6 and 6 Plus , resulted in larger screen sizes However , there were still a significant number of customers who preferred the 4 inch screen size of iPhone 5 and 5S the 5S was the second most popular iPhone after the 6 , ahead of the 6S Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4 inch iPhones in 2015 Furthermore , the 5 and 5S design was regarded as long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general , while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it felt a little bit wrong , as though you were holding a slick 650 bar of soap iPhone 5 was described as elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together It felt streamlined , yet substantial , which is different from iPhone 6 , which feels substantial in size alone Plus , unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6 , iPhone 5 didn t really look like anything else on the market at the time Apple 's product positioning trend \( in North America and Western Europe \) , starting with iPhone 4S released in October 2011 , gave each newly released model one year as the flagship phone , then moving it to midrange for its second year of production , with the third and final year as the entry level offering before discontinuation While iPhone 5S was expected to continue on sale until September 2016 , replacing it and its A7 processor early means that Apple just reduced its long term chip support window by a year for iOS In addition , a new iPhone launch was meant to stimulate demand , as sales of iPhone 6S and 6S Plus had not met expectations since their September 2015 release and the iPhone family may suffer its first ever negative growth quarter in 2016 Specifications Design The exterior design of the iPhone SE is nearly identical to that of the iPhone 5S , and that with the iPhone 5 , specifications are as advanced as the iPhone 6S , with the exception of matte chamfered edges , and an inset stainless steel rear Apple logo It is available in space gray , silver , gold , and rose gold finishes Apple stated that cases designed to fit the 5 and the 5S will also fit an , as the three phones have exactly the same dimensions Hardware As with the 6S , it incorporates the Apple A9 system on chip \( SoC \) , M9 motion coprocessor , and has support for near field communication \( NFC \) iPhone SE features a 4 inch Retina Display at 326 ppi It is available with either 16 or of internal storage It features the same , 1 22 pixel , iSight camera as with the ability to record 720p at 240 fps , 1080p at 120 or 60 fps , and 4K at 30 fps , as well as faster focus , better ISP and Live Photos Despite the iSight camera being shared from iPhone 6S , iPhone SE has a FaceTime camera with f 2 4 aperture , compared to the 5 megapixel FaceTime camera with f 2 2 aperture in the 6S , although it does benefit from the improved image signal processor in the A9 chip and Retina Flash The SE does not include 3D Touch , which would require additional hardware placed beneath the screen , nor the updated faster second generation Touch ID sensor from the 6S It also lacks a barometer , first introduced with the iPhone 6 , which is used to measure relative elevation from air pressure The iPhone SE comes in two hardware models , the A1662 model sold unlocked and by AT T , T Mobile , and Verizon and the A1723 model sold by Sprint or Canadian carriers The iPhone SE Is Not Carrier Agnostic Software iPhone SE ships with , supporting iPhone 6 and 6S exclusive features such as Apple Pay , Live Photos , and always on Siri voice activation Reception Despite iPhone SE sharing the same form factor as iPhone 5S , the SE 's updated internals combined with the latest iOS resulted not only in much improved faster processing speed and camera quality but also longer battery life compared to the other iPhones Although the SE 's 4 inch screen is considered small and the design is four years old , the trade off is that it is a completely pocketable and powerful little consumer camera For phones under 400 , it beats everything else out there that usually by a wide margin \( usually as mid range or compact versions of flagships have significant sacrifices \) iPhone SE review today s tech , yesterday s design The Verge , March 25 , 2016 Two caveats were , as iPhone SE was released midway through the life cycle of iPhone 6S , it
