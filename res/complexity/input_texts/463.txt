sex roles and the incorporation of women into a group or a profession once dominated by men , as it relates to the workplace It is a set of social theories seeking to explain occupational gender related discrepancies Abstract Feminization of the work industry is the pressure created from the cultural turn where the issues of fairness , opportunity , and redistribution in society overcome economic inequalities and find more balance to combat income inequality , social exclusion , and cultural imperialism Jones III Smith Pain Marston 2010 , p 54 78 The issues of sexual differences , gender roles , and employment and services inequalities are questioned , abandoned , and removed Peake 2009 Feminization of the workplace links to the Marxist approach where everyone has the ability to sell his labor power to own the means of production This approach allows women to work in jobs with flexible and family friendly working hours because of their childcare responsibilities Pratt and Hanson 1995 The feminization in the workplace destabilized occupational segregation in society Throughout the 1990s the cultural turn in geography , entwined with the post structuralist concept of difference , led to the discarding of the notion of a coherent , bounded , autonomous and independent identity that was capable of self determination and progress , in favor of a socially constructed category defined by the constitutive outside The earlier distinction between gender as socially created , resting upon the biological distinction of sex , was abandoned , creating room for research that highlighted how gendered subjectivities , far from being based on a stable content , were produced , performed , destabilized and redrawn in complex ways , drawing meaning from routine interactions with others in specific historical and geographical contexts \( Peake 2009 \) Women are entering any form of profession and feminizing the labor force , which was once restricted and dominated by men From exporting personal labor , entering the labor market , challenging the field of science and engineering , and participating in the sports environment , the power and role of women in the society have dramatically changed Categories of feminization Survival Feminization of survival is a term that feminists use to describe a social condition where women are forced into inhumane conditions for the survival of themselves and their families In 1888 , the government of Canada decided to invite skilled Chinese men to work in a gold rush and the Canadian Pacific Railway to reduce the cost of labor wages and to make these projects affordable The Chinese were motivated by desires to leave China and to earn higher wages Hui 2005 Although these immigrants were earning a higher compensation in Canada compared to that in China , they experienced exclusion and occupational inequality Even though the issue of racial exclusion is currently desensitized , there are workers who encounter violence and abuse in their working environment , a majority of which are women Barnett Schmidt 2012 Exporting labor to developed countries is still booming since it creates economic growth and diversity The globalization of labor eases the government debts and unemployment rates of developing countries Women , especially in southeast Asian countries , are attracted to this money making opportunity Rodriguez 2005 The mostly poor and low wage women were often considered burdens rather than resources , but now an increasing number of women are earning a profit and securing government revenues Sassen 2000 Several developing countries in southeast Asia , especially the Philippines , have seen the emergence of exporting labor to developed countries due to high foreign debt and unemployment Filipino women working overseas in the United States of America sent home almost 8 billion a year in 2003 , and most of these women entered the fields of health care , domestic service , and child care Filipino overseas workers have earned the title of migrant heroism for sacrificing their family lives and normalizing migration remittance sending to their motherland Not only do these women hold a higher responsibility in their family and country , but they are also faced with racialization , violence and abuse Labor market In the new era , women restricted the 'spatial reach' of their job searches due to childcare responsibilities The open employment for middle class women catalyzes the growing use of domestic workers for household cleaning and childcare There has been a complexity in the modern economy with women 's responsibility at home and at work Watson 1988 Cultural theories maintain that lower wages in female dominated occupations are the product of societal bias against the work typically carried out by women and that the sex composition of occupations affects wages directly In contrast , recent human capital theories maintain that the wage penalties associated with working in female dominated occupations result from different requirements in specialized training and that the effect is indirect Perales 2010 p 2 Many feminist scholars insist that sexual difference is the primary reason for differences between both sexes in the labor market outcomes Hakim 2006 Women face discrimination in the workplace , such as the glass ceiling , although female participation in the labor market has increased markedly during the past twenty years However , even with increased participation in the labor force and the high levels of commitment that women give to their workplace , women 's work is still undervalued Additionally , many times a woman 's work schedule is structured in such a way that it conflicts with her care giving responsibilities The women who are also union members at work feel side lined and downgraded about the workplace issues that they face that are apart from the union 's agenda However , high levels of unionization strongly correlate with a lower wage gap as well as a lower gender gap One way in which people have tried to help working women is through legislation In late 2003 , Norway passed a law that advocated for forty percent of representation of gender public board companies The main objective for this was to increase the representation of women in top positions in the top sector and decrease gender disparity The result , however , had very little impact on women in business , especially those who made it into corporate sectors On the other side , something that is often ignored is the glass escalator , in which a man enters a female dominated workplace and is quickly promoted through the ranks Several fields such as education , nursing , and social work demonstrate this phenomenon Many factors affect this outcome , such as societal pressure on men and women alike to conform to gender roles , i e , men seeking managerial positions and women seeking more domestic roles Also , even within female dominated professions , men are usually the ones making promotion decisions Despite these setbacks , women have been performing their jobs well Women make up 40 9 of the American workforce , and they are CEOs of some of the largest companies such as PepsiCo , Archer Daniels Midland , and W L Gore Women also earn almost 60 of university degrees from America and Europe They make up the majority of the professional workforce in many countries , for example , fifty one percent in the United States Even with this high percentage , women 's earnings are far less than what men are paid on average They are also intensely under represented at the top of their organizations Surprisingly , feminization of the workplace has been driven by the relentless drive of the service sector and the equal decline of manufacturing More women than ever before are willing to work outside their homes Even after having children , 74 of women in the workforce manage to return to work , and 40 return to their full time jobs Science and technology According to the American Association of University Women , young boys' and girls' capabilities and interests in science , mathematics and engineering are equally well established however , most girls begin to lose their interest in their high school years because of the gap in gender representation in both science and engineering Hanson and Kraus 1998 As a result , women are underrepresented in science related occupations due to the gendered interactions early in life Hanson \( 2007 \) Researchers claim that the segregation of men and women into different occupations is the principal reason for earning differences between men and women They argue that occupational segregation restricts people 's choice of career Researchers also observed both gender 's general behaviors that can represent their preferred profession , finding that the boys are encouraged \( and assumed \) to be outgoing , analytical , and aggressive , while girls are encouraged \( and assumed \) to be passive , dependent , and nurturing In the last 25 years , increasing involvement of women and minorities has prevented a severe shortage of science and engineering workers but if current rates of gender and ethnic participation in these bachelor 's degree programs do not change , the number of qualified workers will soon be inadequate to meet the science , technology , and engineering needs of society Cabrera , Colbeck and Terezini \( 2001 \) p 173 There is an under representation of women in the STEM fields According to a study done by the U S Department of Commerce , in the United States women account for approximately twenty four percent of the STEM workforce , while making up forty eight percent of the overall workforce There are a variety of factors that contribute to this discrepancy such as lack of female role models , gender stereotypes , and sexism in hiring The roots of under representation are in grade school , where girls fall behind boys in math because they are led to believe they are not as intelligent as boys and therefore incapable of being good at math Other influences include teachers , family , culture , stereotypes , and role models throughout school Women are earning the same number of bachelor 's degrees as men but only account for thirty percent of STEM degrees Women who earn these degrees are more likely to go into healthcare or education rather than STEM professions The wage gap with in STEM jobs is smaller than in non STEM jobs Women in STEM careers earn thirty five percent more than women in non STEM careers They also earn more than men with non STEM jobs Female engineering majors match their male counterparts in number who go into the engineering occupation , but physical and life sciences majors turned toward a broader range of careers outside STEM Within these career fields , there is a pattern of sexist hiring practices that lead to less women being hired in these fields The lack of women in these fields creates a cold work environment that causes women to quit In the life sciences , women are earning more doctorates than men , but only one third are hired as assistant professors after completing their PhD However , once hired , they are more likely to prosper in the STEM profession Women who have a family are more likely to switch to a non STEM major or work fewer hours than men in the same fields Sports In the United States , women are seen as 'ill equipped' to participate in sports , and their involvement was viewed as unfeminine and undesirable Today , women represent forty one percent of high school athletes and thirty seven percent of college athletes Increasing numbers of women are participating in sports at the professional level as well The passage of Title IX sparked the increase in women participating in sports throughout high school and college in the United States Title IX of the 1972 Educational Amendments Act prohibits discrimination based on gender to any educational program receiving federal funding Since the passage of Title IX , women in collegiate sports has increased dramatically In 1981 the number of women participating in collegiate sports was 74 , 329 , and by 2001 , that number increased to 150 , 916 In addition , the number of female participants have increased from about twenty five percent of the student athlete population to forty two percent Before 1972 and the passage of Title IX , women were , for the most part , absent from sports in high school In 1972 only one in twenty seven women participated in high school sports , but by 1998 that statistic became one in three Following the passage of Title IX , the number of girls participating in athletics rose from 294 , 015 to 817 , 073 After only six years that number increased even more to over two million girls getting involved in high school sports Prior to 1972 girls only made up seven percent of student athletes and that number rose to thirty two percent in 1978 This was a momentous time for women in sports because there was finally more representation across the board Compared to women , one in two males participate in high school sports After the passing of Title IX , the number of women managing and coaching sports in general has decreased The number of women in administrative positions within sports declined seventeen percent from 1972 1987 It was also found that in Texas schools women only made up six percent of the athletic directors and that in Florida only thirteen percent were women In addition to administrative positions , women coaches have seen a significant decline in count after Title IX was passed In 1973 , women coaches were at an all time high of around eighty percent , but over the next ten years that number rapidly declined to around forty percent despite the increasing opportunities for women Ever since Title IX was passed , female head coaches have been harder and harder to find , especially from 1977 1982 , when there was a thirty six percent decrease This issue has still not improved much since 1972 , even though Title IX was implemented to prevent this
