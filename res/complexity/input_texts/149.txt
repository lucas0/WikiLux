\) of the Cincinnati Bengals He now blocks for LaDainian Tomlinson of the San Diego Chargers , and is considered to be the best blocking fullback in the league , and draws admiration from fellow fullbacks for his unselfishness , most notably Tony Richardson who once said in a NFL Films reel I 'd like to think of myself as a pretty good player at fullback , but Lorenzo Neal is on a whole 'nother level The New Orleans Saints drafted Neal in the fourth round \( 89th overall \) in the 1993 NFL Draft Neal wore number 22 1993 Suffered season ending ankle injury at Atlanta on September 12

the Pro Bowl for the third time Neal has had a very interesting career that provides an example of one of the role filling positions in football that do not often receive accolade In football , unlike baseball , performers like Neal cannot be statistically quantified in any way , much like the number of blocks thrown by an offensive lineman \( Often their Cantonization is achieved because of who they blocked for while the way in which they blocked remains visual \( bruising , phsical \) and not statistical \( 59 pancake blocks \) \) Neal remains one of the most punishing blockers in the NFL today As opposing linebackers are always aware of 2007 MVP running back LaDainian Tomlinson in the Chargers backfield but may be more wary of Lorenzo Neal and his 5 foot 11 , 255 pound body trying to level them to the ground Neal has had a 14 year career to this point , and most of it has been exclusively on his ability to level opposing tacklers and not to allow them to tackle his running back He has made seven straight Pro Bowls as of now so obvioulsy his contribution has not gone unnoticed to everyone His career is an interesting one and its story deserves to be put down Neal was born in California near Fresno in 1970 and grew up there He went to Lenmore High School and was a very successful football player but football actually was n't his best sport He also was a state champion heavyweight wrestler His success in wrestling continued when he went to college at Fresno State and was an All American wrestler there Neal also played football at Fresno State , of course Despite his great NFL success in the blocking role Neal was not always supposed to be a blocker In college he was a great running back at Fresno State , setting the school record with 2405 rushing yards over his career there He also graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice Because of his great success as a runner Neal was projected to be a successful runner in the NFL as well He was drafted by the New Orleans Saints in the 4th round in the 1993 NFL draft as a running back Two games into his career he looked like a great pick as in his first game he had gained 89 yards on 13 carries and in the second game he broke off a 74 yard touchdown run with his first carry Neal may have become a great running back , but later in the game Neal suffered an injury that would dramatically change the course of his career He broke his ankle in the third quarter of that 2nd game of his career while taking his third carry of the game He was out for the rest of the year His final stats for that year were impressive for limited time , 175 yards in 21 carries and an extremely impressive 8 3 yards per carry But the injury had made Neal a forgotten man for the Saints and also taken away much of his speed He had a big frame though and was made a fullback the next year The Saints drafted running back Mario Bates next year to take the place as the Saints feature back for the 1994 season Neal did not originally take kindly to the move He had gotten the ball ever since he had started playing football Unfortunately , he took out his anger against Bates When they were at a bar Neal insisted that Bates should provide him with money to buy a drink as a rookie Bates refused and Neal proceeded to punch him in the face , breaking his jaw and sidelining him for four weeks Perhaps this incident made Neal all the more determined to get over his stuggles and unhappiness and just do the job he was presented with He played in all 16 games for the Saints in '94 as a blocking fullback This would be his permanent position for the rest of his career With the Saints he continued to develop and learn this position He had been humbled somewhat by his incident with Bates , and , most importantly , was never complained about again in the future as a clubhouse distraction In fact as he got older he became a team leader and a great personality who gets along well with interviewers and reporters alike In 2005 he was named to NFL com 's All Interview Team for the best interviews in football It would have been hard to imagine Neal maturing that much after the incident he had earlier As he moved on in his career Neal became progressively better In 1997 with the Jets he helped running back Adrian Murrell to a 1 , 000 yard season This would be the first of Neal 's current streak of 10 straight years blocking for a 1 , 000 yard runner His success has come with so many different backs \( Murrell , Warrick Dunn , Eddie George , Corey Dillon , and Tomlinson \) that it is hard to claim Neal 's consistency in delivering these runners is mere coincidence Neal has another record attribute of great significance outside of his blocking excellence , and that is his durability Ever since that injury in the 1993 season Neal has played every single game every single year , 192 straight games Neal rates along with Brett Favre as perhaps the most consistently durable player in the NFL today Much of Neal 's impressive strength and conditioning comes from his tough offseason training The training that he had received as a wrestler plays a key role in his success as a professional football player even today He works out in the offseason with wrestlers and boxers and his brother , Eddie , is a professional heavyweight boxer Today Neal receives acccolades as the best fullback in the league as the key lead blocker for stud back LaDainian Tomlinson He also is now a very dignified presence for the Chargers He helps to administrate a foundation with the Chargers which stresses getting a college education to young athletes in Fresno After his career Neal wants to join sports broadcasting He has already made token appearances on NFL Network as a host on NFL Total Access Neal is a great player , a great fullback , and has been key to the success of this year 's MVP His legacy will not be soon forgotten Of course , Neal still remains one of the best in the NFL despite his old age \( currently 36 years old \) Perhaps the Hall of Fame is even in his future Quotes People like the melons , the strawberries , the bananas they like the tomatoes I'm like that old onion When you want a good hamburger , you 've got to call on that old onion Neal on his role in the Chargers offense References Category 1970 births Category American football fullbacks Category American
