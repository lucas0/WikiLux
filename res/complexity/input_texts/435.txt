Anti prom , also known as morp \( prom spelled in reverse \) , is a social event often staged by high school students as a protest against , or boycott of , their school 's official prom , as an alternative celebration Other times , it may be an unofficial prom , planned by the students themselves so that it is not under the control of the school Some of the more common reasons for the creation of an anti prom include the desire to curb the large cost of a traditional prom , to listen to music other than that expected to be played at the official prom , to have a smaller , more personal get together , ones that cannot find a date or have been rejected for a prom date , do n't like the food , or have looser and less strict rules than the school 's \( often relating to dress rules or alcohol consumption \) Another common anti prom is an unofficial dance set up by freshmen and sophomores as they cannot go to prom without a junior or senior The attendees of an anti prom usually disagree with the values of the high school in crowd who , stereotypically , organize the prom from the preparatory stages to the after parties In particular , anti prom attendees protest what they regard as the vanity , excess , and conformity that the prom culture expects from students Anti proms do not follow any prescribed format , catering instead to the varied tastes of the large spectrum of students who feel dissociated from prom culture Nevertheless , anti prom participants are generally concerned with arranging social activities that are not only fun and enjoyable , but which also serve as an assertion of solidarity and of the legitimacy of social difference Queer proms Sexual orientation and gender identity sometimes plays a role in leading students to form and attend an anti prom \( sometimes referred to as a gay prom or queer prom \) lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , queer , and questioning \( LGBTQQ \) students who feel that attending their school 's traditional prom with a same sex partner or not identifying in traditional gender identity fashion would be problematic might choose to hold their own gathering Gay proms began to form in the 1990s , with one of the longest running and oldest being the Hayward Gay Prom , which was first held in 1995 References Category American culture Category School dances Category LGBT culture in the United States ru
