Magazine , and to Paranormal Magazine In addition , he is the zoological consultant for Guinness World Records In January 2013 , Shuker launched the Journal of Cryptozoology As the journal 's founding editor in chief , Shuker has the goal of providing an outlet for cryptozoological research with a genuinely scientific approach , with the hope of elevating the field 's reputation among the scientific community Scientific approach Shuker engages in what he describes as the scientific investigation of animals still awaiting formal zoological detection and description in the 21st century However , Shuker is critical of investigators who set out to uncritically validate their preconceptions , stating that such activity is not serious cryptozoology Shuker 's approach also sometimes leads to a more reserved position regarding cryptid claims Having investigated the mystery of the chupacabra , Shuker noted in an interview with Benjamin Radford that the inconsistencies surrounding descriptions and accounts of the creature made it difficult to separate actual reports from folklore Based on his interpretation of available accounts and evidence of the creature , Shuker hypothesized that the chupacabra itself might be a nonexistent composite resulting from accounts of different entities all being lumped together Critical reception In a 1996 review of Shuker 's book Dragons A Natural History in Natural History , Richard Ellis discussed the impressive assortment of illustrations , as well as Shuker 's coverage of dragon imagery and icons throughout history , but criticized a lack of focus on the 'real' animals held to be responsible for some of the dragon or sea serpent stories , such as the crocodile , the Komodo dragon , the African rock python , and the oarfish Ellis found fault with coverage of aquatic serpent dragons such as the Loch Ness monster , lamenting that despite corroborated evidence that the famous Loch Ness monster 's 'surgeon 's photograph' was a hoax , 'Nessie' is one of the contemporary 'dragons' in this book In June 1997 Shuker criticized Fortean Times publisher Mike Dash , who has described most reports of strange phenomena to be products of the imagination , to which Shuker stated , there are some intriguing pieces of evidence for the existence of a large underwater mammal in Loch Ness , not least the sonar soundings of 1972 which showed the presence of a 6 ft flipper However , in a 1998 Sunday Times interview , Shuker suggested that the Loch Ness monster was losing traction , with more attention going toward large cat sightings , stating , They 're more tangible , and that a ny scientist who these days decides to take the Loch Ness monster seriously knows that it will damage his reputation Reviewing Shuker 's 2003 book The Beasts that Hide from Man , Mark Bayless described the work as thought provoking and well researched , contrasting Shuker 's work favorably against other cryptozoology texts as providing a scholarly , reader friendly format , and addressing a wider range of cryptids that are not covered in comparable sources Awards and honors In 2005 , a new species of Loricifera was named Pliciloricus shukeri , after Shuker Books Mystery Cats of the World \( 1989 \) , Robert Hale , ISBN 0 7090 3706 6 Extraordinary Animals Worldwide \( 1991 \) , Robert Hale , ISBN 0
