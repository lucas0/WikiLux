OXO Biodegradable OXO biodegradation is defined by CEN \( the European Standards Organisation \) CEN TR 1535 2006 as degradation resulting from oxidative and cell mediated phenomena , either simultaneously or successively https publications europa eu nl publication detail publication bb3ec82e 9a9f 11e6 9bca 01aa75ed71a1 Sometimes described as OXO degradable this describes only the first or oxidative phase These descriptions should not be used for material which degrades by the process of OXO biodegradation defined by CEN , and the correct description is OXO biodegradable There are two different types of biodegradable plastic Oxo biodegradable plastic , made from polymers such as PE \( polyethylene \) , PP \( polypropylene \) , and PS \( polystyrene \) containing extra ingredients \( metal salts \) and tested according to ASTM D6954 or BS8472 or AFNOR Accord T51 808 to degrade and biodegrade in the open environment Vegetable based plastics \( also loosely knows as bio plastics bioplastics or compostable plastics \) These are tested in accordance with ASTM D6400 or EN13432 to biodegrade in the conditions found in industrial composting or biogas facilities OXO bio plastic is conventional polyolefin plastic to which has been added small amounts of metal salts These salts catalyze the degradation process to speed it up so that the OXO plastic will degrade abiotically at the end of its useful life in the presence of oxygen much more quickly than ordinary plastic At the end of this process it is no longer visible , as it has been converted via Carboxylation or Hydroxylation to small chain organic chemicals which will then biodegrade when the right fungi and or bacteria are present The degradation process is shortened for abiotic degradation and thereafter the rate of biodegradation depends on the micro organisms in the environment Timescale for complete biodegradation is much shorter than for conventional plastics which , in normal environments , are very slow to biodegradehttp cmore soest hawaii edu cruises super biodegradation htm Mote Marine Laboratory , 1993 and cause large scale harm There is however a lot of doubt on the

The speed depends on the environment Conventional polyethylene \( PE \) and polypropylene \( PP \) plastics will typically take decades to degrade But OXO biodegradable products utilize a prodegradant to speed up the molecular breakdown of the polyolefins and to incorporate oxygen atoms into the resulting low molecular mass molecules This chemical change enables the further breakdown of the material by naturally occurring micro organisms thumb 300px right Illustration of the OXO Degradation A process whereby the conventional polyolefin plastic is first oxidised to short chain oxygenated molecules which are biodegradable \( typically after two to four months of exposure \) The first process of degradation in OXO treated plastic is an oxidative chain scission that is catalyzed by metal salts leading to oxygenated \( hydroxylated and carboxylated \) shorter chain molecules OXO plastic , if discarded in the environment , will degrade to oxygenated low molecular weight chains \( typically MW 5 10 000 amu \) within 2 18 months depending on the material \( resin , thickness , anti oxidants , etc \) and the temperature and other factors in the environment OXO plastics are designed so that they will not degrade deep in landfill and they will not therefore generate methane \( a powerful greenhouse gas \) in anaerobic conditions OXO biodegradable products do not degrade immediately in an open environment because they are stabilized to give the product a useful service life They will nevertheless break down into smaller fragments OXO biodegradation of polymer material has been studied in depth at the Technical Research Institute of Sweden and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences A peer reviewed report of the work was published in Vol 96 of the journal of Polymer Degradation Stability \( 2011 \) at page 919 928 It shows 91 biodegradation in a soil environment within 24 months , when tested in accordance with ISO 17556 Standards applicability OXO biodegradable plastic degrades in the presence of oxygen , and the process is accelerated by UV and heat It can be recycled during its useful life with normal plastic It is not designed to be compostable in industrial composting facilities according to ASTM D6400 or EN13432 , but it can be composted in an in vessel process These standards require the material to convert to CO2 gas within 180 days because industrial composting has a short timescale and is not the same as degradation in the open environment A leaf is generally considered to be biodegradable but it will not pass the composting standards due to the 180 day limit \( Indeed , materials which do comply with AST D6400 , EN13432 , Australian 4736 and ISO 17088 cannot properly be described as compostable This is because those standards require them to convert substantially to CO2 gas within 180 days You cannot therefore make them into compost only into CO2 gas This contributes to climate change , but does nothing for the soil There is an American Standard \( ASTM D6954 \) and a British Standard \( BS8472 \) which specifies procedures to test degradability , biodegradability , and non toxicity , and with which a properly designed and manufactured OXO product complies It also contains pass fail criteria to exclude any significant gel content which might inhibit degradation There is no need to refer to a Standard Specification unless a specific disposal route \( e g composting \) , is envisaged ASTM D6400 Australian 4736 and EN13432 are Standard Specifications appropriate only for the special conditions found in industrial composting Another reference document has recently been published by the French standards organisation AFNOR This document AC 51 808AC T51 808 Plastiques valuation exp rimentale de l'oxobiod gradabilit de mat riaux polyol finiques sous forme de films M thodologie et exigences offers a well researched method to test OXO biodegradable plastics based on usage and climate conditions It introduces a new testing method for the biodegradation of polymer using selected microorganisms and measuring ATP and ADP by chemiluminescence This method brings a new approach as tests are done at 37 C which is much more relevant to outdoor conditions than ASTM D6400 or EN 13432 done at 58 C plus the microorganisms are identified based on the environment in which the plastic is likely to be disposed , which is not the case with the CO2 evolution method This French document is a very interesting innovation for predicting the behaviour of an OXO biodegradable plastic in case of littering This test method provides an ecotoxicity testing method to ensure that residues in the environment , pending complete biodegradation , are not toxic for the Rhodococcus

used in many places as a solution to the problem of plastic litter in the open environment They are mandatory in some areas of the Middle East , Asia and Africa However many countries are coming back on this and are going to ban the use of this type of plasticshttps publications europa eu nl publication detail publication bb3ec82e 9a9f 11e6 9bca 01aa75ed71a1 There is rising evidence that increase of littering takes place when the user believes the bags are fully biodegradablehttps publications europa eu nl publication detail publication bb3ec82e 9a9f 11e6 9bca 01aa75ed71a1 Another often heard issue is the addition of too high concentrations of lead and cobalt https www theguardian com environment cif green 2009 jun 18 greenwash biodegradeable plastic bags It is clear that millions of tons of plastics are in the environment and a lot of countries do not have the capacity to recycle them It is estimated that of the 300 million tons of plastic produced annually in the world only 3 is recycled Oxo plastics however are not advisable to be recycled since they hamper the recycling process Call to ban On 6 November 2017 , more than 150 organisations , including M S , PepsiCo , Unilever , Veolia , World Wildlife Fund , British Plastics Association and Gulf Petrochemicals and Chemicals Association , backed a call to ban oxo biodegradable plastics This was supported by ten members of the European Parliament from nine countries This report was heavily disputed by the oxo biodegradable plastics industry http www biodeg org OPA 20Press 20release 20on 20MacArthur 20report 20 2013 11 17 pdf The call for a ban was contained in a paper released by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation , which brought together research from a wide range of sources that showed oxo biodegradable plastics , also known as oxodegradables , do not safely biodegrade , but fragment into small pieces The Oxo biodegradable Plastics Association , which represents manufacturers , distributors and users of oxo biodegradable products , was not approached to give evidence or undertake any research In addition to highlighting concerns about the health and environmental impact of oxo biodegradables , the paper also concluded this type of material is not suited for long term reuse , recycling at scale or composting Hence , it does not allow materials and products to be kept in high value use , meaning they cannot be part of a circular economy The Oxo Biodegradable Plastics Association claimed the report was inaccurate , misleading and confusing They accused many of the 150 organisations of aggressively promoted a rival technology called bio plastic and many of the others whose logos appeared in the document are themselves producers of many of the plastic items which get into the open environment The paper 's conclusions were partly disputed by Professor Ignacy Jacubowicz , who said the degradation process was not a fragmentation , but a change from a high molecular weight polymer to a material that can be bio assimilated He however stated that oxo biodegradable plastics were not a general solution to environmental problems http www symphonyenvironmental com macarthur report discredited oxo
