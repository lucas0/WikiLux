Adventures in Odyssey , also known as AIO or simply Odyssey , is an Evangelical Christian themed radio drama comedy series created by Focus on the Family in 1987 The series centers on the fictional town of Odyssey , and in particular , an ice cream and discovery emporium called Whit 's End , and its proprietor , John Avery Whittaker Episodes range from comedic melodramatic and usually feature thematic and Bible references Characters openly discuss Christianity and sometimes Bible stories are retold Now in it 's 20th year , AIO has spanned 630 half hour radio episodes , 13 pilot episodes , 17 animated videos , 15 books , and numerous edutainment computer games , in addition to related merchandise and the Passages spinoff book series The show can be heard on hundreds of radio stations in the United States , Canada and around the world History Beginnings In the spring of 1986 , Focus on the Family founder James Dobson interviewed Bruce Wilkinson on the subject of media influence in modern society Wilkinson told Dobson that complaining about media programming was not enough that Christians should produce their own programming as a replacement In response , Dobson called on Steve Harris to launch a radio series Focus on the Family hired Phil Lollar , a filmmaker and screenwriter , to assist Harris in creating the program Lollar named the town Odyssey and the name of the program 's main character was chosen John Avery Whittaker Whit 's End was created , and Lollar wrote detailed histories and descriptions of Odyssey , John Avery Whittaker , and Whit 's End In early fall , Focus on the Family decided to finance a 13 episode test series called Family Portraits , which would determine whether the idea would fly or fail The pilot was written and produced and it aired on January 5 , 1987 Because of the positive audience response , it was decided to go full force with Odyssey In November 1987 , the first Odyssey episode aired The Program was called Odyssey USA The First Eight Years 1988 to 1996 A major change occurred in April 1988 , after only 24 episodes of the new program It was argued that the inclusion of USA in the program 's name would alienate listeners outside the United States \( and , in particular , in Canada \) The show 's name was then changed to its present title , Adventures in Odyssey During this time , over 300 episodes were written and major storylines were introduced Over 25 albums were also released containing episodes from the radio series 1997 Present After eight years of non stop production , the format and schedule of production needed a change Therefore , a break was called and from December 1996 to September 1997 production halted on Adventures In Odyssey When the show came back there were significant changes All previous child characters were discontinued and new ones brought in , with the exception of Rodney Rathbone New storylines were introduced and new writers were used Production wise , the season approach , like television , was introduced and has been used since then Structure Format AIO does not fall cleanly into a particular category Episode plots range from the farcical \( e g , 440 I Slap Floor \) to the extremely serious \( e g , 499 , Exit \) In all , approximately one third of all episodes fall in the purely comic category , a third in the purely dramatic category , and the remaining third are hybrid However , all episodes are written to convey some moral , and a Bible reference verse , and are written to be both entertaining and acceptable to all age groups Most radio episodes are written to fit in a half hour broadcast window , though it is not uncommon for a single episode to span multiple half hour segments , divided into numbered parts \( each carrying their own production number \) Initially , each AIO episode began and ended with a short story segment , usually around two minutes total , involving the program 's host , Chris These wrap arounds introduced and highlighted the subject of the episode at the end , Chris would give the Bible verses supporting the theme of the particular episode , as well as production credits and , occasionally , contact information for Focus on the Family It was eventually decided that these wrap arounds were so elaborate that they detracted from the main story and Odyssey plotline Starting in 1991 , Chris 's role was reduced to a brief introduction \( Hi , this is Chris Welcome to Adventures in Odyssey ! \) , followed by John Campbell 's AIO music theme However , Chris retained the role of concluding each episode with a recapitulation and biblical reference The theme song has remained the same since the beginning , although there have been variations Broadcasts AIO is broadcast through thousands of radio stations in the United States and Canada Station finder In addition , online broadcasting occurs through OnePlace com Listen online Many stations rerun episodes daily \( synchronous with one another \) new episodes are aired on Saturday mornings , at 10 00 AM Releases See Album list for more information AIO has released a total of 48 albums , containing episodes from the radio drama All

saga Main article Blackgaard saga The Blackgaard saga is the definitive AIO storyline , with its roots first mentioned in 19 , Recollections , and its encore in 424 425 , Blackgaard 's Revenge , parts 1 2 Thus , the saga was broadcast over a total of 11 years The saga includes the 11 part Darkness Before Dawn series , originally broadcast in 1995 The saga recounts the ongoing battle between John Avery Whittaker and his nemesis , Dr Regis Blackgaard , over two different items first , a computer program Whittaker developed for the National Security Agency named Applesauce , and second , a mineral found beneath Whit 's End that forms the active ingredient in the enzyme TA 418 , a chemical weaponizer Eugene And Katrina One of the most popular plot arcs in AIO concerns Eugene Meltsner 's relationship with Katrina Shanks Eugene and Katrina 's relationship was plagued by numerous miscommunications and misunderstandings , which were largely a result of Eugene 's lack of experience when it came to matters of the heart Meltsner Arc Eugene has stumbled upon clues to find his father Novacom saga Main article Novacom saga The largest continuous plot arc attempted to date , the Novacom saga spanned 29 episodes originally aired over a 20 month timeframe , and concerns the attempts of the Novacom Corporation to brainwash Odyssey and , eventually , the world The Novacom series begins with a number of episodes that introduce the Novacom corporation to Odyssey Novacom is a media conglomerate , and buys a number of television and radio stations in the Odyssey area Many of the television programming they run is controversial and violent , which quickly puts Whit and most of the protagonists of Odyssey at odds with Novacom Later it is found that Novacom is trying to mind control the people of Odyssey and the world Over time , an increasing number of voices claim that Novacom is up to no good Special show types In addition to normal shows , which involve characters in the Odyssey fictional universe , a few other formats are frequently used \( in , perhaps , 10 of episodes \) These divergent formats are usually connected to Odyssey by such devices as inventions of John Avery Whittaker , for instance BTV BTV is a television show in Odyssey that is hosted by Bernard Walton BTV episodes consist of several different segments that focus on a common topic Usually the topics deal with Biblical topics with a few extra historical and scientific tibits thrown in KYDS Kids Radio Kids Radio is a radio station run out of Whit 's End While it does n't necessarily broadcast continually it has been used to tell many stories A few of the broadcasted shows have included The Twilife Zone \( a parody of The Twilight Zone , an idea which started much earlier through normal characters' dream sequences and turned into a Kids Radio program \) , The Jimmy Barclay Show , Candid Conversations with Connie , Ask Mitch , \( later changed to Ask Docter Wise \) and O T Action News The Imagination Station The Imagination Station is undoubtedly the most often used plot device , outside of the major characters and Whit 's End Odyssey as a whole , in AIO Indeed , it is almost a character itself , having evolved throughout the AIO storyline and playing a major role in most AIO plot arcs The Imagination Station is one of John Avery Whittaker 's inventions People can use the station to experience historical and biblical events in a seemingly more immersive version of virtual reality The general concept is similar in many respects to the Star Trek holodeck The station is typically used for educational and for other productive reasons however on one occasion the fictional corporation Novacom attempted to exploit its technology to enslave the entire world In the video series episode The Knight Travellers , the Imagination Station is used by the villain as a mind control device , redesigned as the Manipulation Station The Room of Consequence The Room of Consequence , another of Whit 's inventions , was introduced in episode 236 , Into Temptation The idea is that just as the Imagination Station allows individuals to step into the past , the Room of Consequence allows them to see a possible future , usually extrapolated from the decisions the person is making in the present Unlike the Imagination Station , the Room of Consequence does not appear to allow for significant interaction with the future environment The Room of Consequence plays a much smaller role in AIO than the Imagination Station , with only ten episodes including it to date The Transmuter The Transmuter is another one of John Avery Whittaker 's inventions Just as The Imagination Station allows a person to experience the past , and The Room of Consequence allows a person to see a possible future , the Transmuter allows a person to experience the present from another person 's point of view This lets you experience events from a perspective you normally would n't be able to see It debuted in episode 419 , Another Man 's Shoes The Transmuter is described as bearing a resemblance to the weight scales in a doctor 's office Related products Video series 1 \) The Knight

Message The Mystery of the Hooded Horsemen Criticisms The Split episodes era The Split episodes era refers to a time period when two quarter hour episodes were written and designed to air within the same half hour time slot This format was not popular with most listeners and the split episode format was discontinued Officer David Harley Officer Harley made his first appearance in the third AIO episode , Lights Out at Whit 's End His final appearance was on an unreleased 2 part arc called The Return of Harley His character was one of a local Police Officer that was not too bright but with a good heart and good intentions His appearance on the show caused a large amount of response from parents concerned about how his persona would send the wrong message about real police officers and his character was later dropped with the majority of his shows either re recorded or shelved Religious Intollerance Adventures in Odyssey have been accused on numerous occasions for being religiously intollerant after their series Passages \( played on during the program Focus on the Family \) identified Pagans in a negative light They were accused of suggesting that Pagans and non christian religions should not be permitted free rights or freedom of speech , and that Pagans have no respect for human life When these accusations were confirmed as truth by the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance , the radio program Focus on the Family were offered the chance to attend a talk on religious tollerance They turned down this suggestion with the statement \( in part \) thanks for your offer I trust you can understand that it would be counter productive for us to forge a partnership at this point Notes Phil Lollar , The Complete Guide to Adventures in Odyssey \( Focus on
