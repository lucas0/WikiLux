Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists \( Arabic Waliyat al Faqih Persian , Velayat e Faqih \) is a concept in Shi'a Islam which holds that Islam gives faqih \( Islamic jurists \) custodianship or guardianship over those in need of it While this idea is accepted by Ulema among Ja'fari jurisprudence \( fiqh of Twelvers \) there is disagreement over how encompassing custodianship should be One interpretation is limited Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists , holding that guardianship should be limited to religious endowments \( \) \( Owaqaf \) http english awqaf ir judicial matters , to Owghaf \( religious welfare \) Another illimitable \( \) guardianship of the Islamic Jurists holds that Guardianship should include all issues for which Prophet of Islam and Shi'a Imam had responsibility , including governance of the country By far the most famous use of the concept of illimitable guardianship of the Islamic Jurists is in the Islamic Republic of Iran , where a faqih , or Vali ye faqih \( guardian jurist \) , serves as the Supreme Leader of the governmentInterview with Grand Ayatollah Yusef Saanei Public Broadcasting Station Frontline Feb 2002 in accordance with the Iranian constitution In the context of Iran the concept is often referred to as rule by the jurisprudent , or rule of the Islamic jurist Theory of Velayat Faqih Wilayat conveys several intricate meanings which are deeply tied to their history Morphologically , it is derived from the Arabic wilaya the verbal noun of waliyan to be near and to have power over something Technically , wilyat means rule , supremacy or sovereignty In another sense , wilayat means friendship , loyalty , or guardianship \( see Wali \) Ahmad Moussavi , The Theory of Vilayat i Faqih The doctrinal basis of Velayat Faqih comes at least in part from the hadith where the Prophet Muhammad is reputed to have said The fuqaha are the trustees of the prophets There is a wide spectrum of ideas about Wilayat Faqih among Jafari scholars ranging from guardianless activities \( \) in Islamic society , such as unattended children , to absolute authority \( \) in all public matters Two types of Wilayah can be understood The first type of Wilayah is mentioned in various chapters of Fiqh of Shia It discusses Wilayah over the dead and Wilayah over others in need of guardianship , such as insane \( \) , absentee \( \) , poor \( \) , etc For example verse 33 of Sora 17 http www usc edu dept MSA quran 017 qmt html refers to authority of heir of oppressed slain This type of Wilayah can not be applied to a society because none of mentioned characteristics apply to human society The second type of Wilayah which appears in principles of faith and kalam discusses about Wilayah over sagacious and wise people The verse 55 of Sora 5 http www usc edu dept MSA quran 005 qmt html implies the second type of Wilayah in Quran The guardianship of jurisprudance can be underestood from this second type of Wilayah only Believing Wilayat Faqih is not the matter of following a marja but should be underestood by reason and needs intellectual reason This will guide us toward the concept of Wilayah of Fiqh or guardianship of jurisprudence which is essense of Wilayah of Faqih Limited guardianship of the Islamic Jurists Traditionally Shi'a jurists have tended to this interpretation and leave secular power for Shi'a kings which is called Sultan and they should defend the territory against non Shias For example , according to Iranian scholar Ervand Abrahamian , in centuries of debate among Shi'a scholars , none have ever explicitly contended that monarchies per se were illegitimate or that the senior clergy had the authority to control the state Most scholars viewed the clergy 's main responsibilities \( i e their guardianship or velayat e faqih \) as being to study the law based on the Koran , the Prophet 's traditions , and the teachings of the Twelve Imams They were also to use reason to update these laws issue pronouncements on new problems adjudicate in legal disputes and distribute the khoms contributions to worthy widows , orphans , seminary students , and indigent male descendants of the Prophet Khomeinism Essays on the Islamic Republic by Ervand Abrahamian c1993 \( Professor of History at Baruch College , in the City University of New York According to one of the leading Ayatullahs , Sayyid Ali Husaini al Sistani , Velayat Faqih means every jurisprudent \( Faqih \) has wilayah \( guardianship \) over non litigious affairs Non litigious affairs are technically called `al omour al hesbiah` As for general affairs with which social order is linked , wilayah of a Faqih and enforcement of wilayah depend on certain conditions one of which is popularity of acceptability of Faqih among majority of momeneen Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani has often been identified with the quietist school of thought , which seeks to keep religion out of the political sphere until the return of the Imam of the Age , despite his indirect but decisive role in most major Iraqi political decisions Absolute guardianship of Islamic Jurists Supporters of absolute guardianship cite verse 62 of sora 24 http www usc edu dept MSA quran 024 qmt html and believe that collective affairs \( \) are under Wilayah of Faqih at most Those scholars who believe in necessity of establishing Islamic state say that within the boundary of public affairs the Wilayah must be absolute , otherwise the state can not govern the country See religious democracy The most popular and influential advocate of the idea of the absolute guardianship of the jurist was the Ayatollah Khomeini who exponded on it in his book Hokumat e Islami Valiyat e faqih \( Islamic Government Guardianship of the Jurist \) In fact he represented a theory of state for twelvers during the Occultation of Imam According to it , those most knowledgeable about Islamic law \( Shari'ah \) should assume a guiding or leading political role in society History Limited Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist has been known since Sheikh Mofid , When Ijtihad among Shi'a emerged in 10th CE \( 4AH \) On the basis of this jurists have judged and take Khoms Absolute Velayat e faqih was probably first introduced in the Fiqh of Jafari in the famous text book Javaher al Kalem \( \) Later , Ayatollah Molla Mohammad Mahdee Naraqi of Iran published a paper advocating a modest level of political actions for Islamic leaders limited velayat e faqih By the time of Iranian Constitutional Revolution \( \) , Ayatollah Sheikh Fazlollah Nouri customized this theory to match with Iranian Majles of National Council , which was removed when he was executed by revolutionists Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had originally supported a limited interpretation of Velayat e faqih in his first political statements We do not say that government must be in the hands of the faqih Islam and Revolution \( p 170 \) and asserting that the practical power of the mujtaheds excludes the government and includes only simple matters such as legal rulings , religious judgments , and intervention to protect the property of minors and the weak Even when rulers are oppressive and against the people , they the mujtaheds will not try to destroy the rulers Kashf i Asrar , \( Secrets Revealed \) \( Tehran , n d \) p 186 quoted in quoted in Abrahamian , Ervand , Iran Between Two Revolutions , p 476 He later changed his views and in 1970 gave a series of lectures that became a book Hokumat e Islami Valiyat e faqih arguing that monarchy was unIslamic In a true Islamic state those holding government posts should have knowledge of Sharia , and the country 's ruler should be a faqih 11 who surpasses all others in knowledge of Islamic law and justice Islam and Revolution , \( p 59 \) \( p 59 \) known as a marja` as well as having intelligence and administrative ability This theory was put into action as part of Iran 's Islamic Revolution But generally before then , by the time of Ayatollah Naraqi it was first produced and forced into Iran 's royal law allowing Iranian ayatollahs to make sure that Islamic laws impacted the general laws of Iran Velayat Faqih in practice Iran has become the first nation state in history to apply Velayat Faqih in the government According to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Today , the government of the Iranian people is recognized as a model for all the peoples of the world politicians , religious scholars , and scientists make requests in various manners , in order to benefit from the Iranian help , guidance , and support Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad As Soon as Iran Achieves Advanced Technologies , It Has the Capacity to Become an Invincible Global Power 28 September 2006 Political matters in Iran Guardianship of the faqih in the Islamic Republic of Iran is represented not only in the Supreme Leader who must be a cleric but in other leading bodies , particularly the Assembly of Experts whose members must be clerics and the Council of Guardians , half of whom must be mullahs Although the Islamic Republic has an elected lower legislative chamber , or the Majles like the earlier constitution of the 1906 Revolution , its power is greatly circumscribed by the Council of Guardians The Council vetoes any bills from the Majles it \( the council \) , deems to be against the sharia , and any candidates wishing to run for the Majles it believes lacking in Islamic credentials For example , 145 out of the 356 candidates who filed to run for 17 seats in the special 2001 Majles election were rejected by the Council of Guardians Iranian Leadership http www globalsecurity org military world iran leadership htm Recently , attempts have been made to conceal the power of mullahs with the new speaker of Majles and president , Gholam Ali Haddad Adel and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , respectively Aside from these two bodies , the Islamic Republic has what some call a parallel

parents can enter a university without passing a test on Islam No one born to Muslim parents may convert to another religion as per sharia this constitutes apostasy As a result , for example , one cannot study physics at a university without having attained a substantial understanding of Islam and Arabic Economic implications The preamble to the constitution rejects capitalism implicitly by

Grand Ayatollah Hossein Montazeri and Ayatollah Mohamed Hossein Kazemini Borujerdi Misunderstandings 1 There is a wide spectrum of ideas about Wilayat Faqih among Jafari scholars and it is not limitted to two ideas mentioned above The spectrum starts from guardianless activities \( \) in Islamic society , such as unattended children , and ends to absolute authority \( \) in all public matters 2 Two types of Wilayah can be undertood The first type of Wilayah which is mensioned in various chapters of Fiqh of Shia discusses about Wilayah over the deads and Wilayah over whom resembles

\) as Marja' e Taqlid It was only after his death that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini published his first political and social notice in which he invited all people to rise for Allah This was due to the fact of his believing on Wilayah of Ayatollah Hosain Borujerdi 7 Nobody believes that the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran is the best implementation in the framework of Wilayat Faqih In fact its chapter XIV has been entitled The Revision of the Constitution and it revised one time yet http mellat majlis ir archive CONSTITUTION ENGLISH HTM Also it is a good idea to separate the theory and
