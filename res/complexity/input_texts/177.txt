Vicarius Filii Dei \( Latin Vicar or Representative of the Son of God \) is a phrase first used in the forged medieval Donation of Constantine to refer to Saint Peter , a leader of the Early Christian Church and regarded as the first Pope by the Catholic Church Origins and uses of the phrase The earliest known instance of the phrase Vicarius Filii Dei is in the Donation of Constantine , now dated between the eighth and the ninth centuries AD Johann Peter Kirsch states that many of the recent critical students of the document i e Donation of Constantine locate its composition at Rome and attribute the forgery to an ecclesiastic , their chief argument being an intrinsic one this false document was composed in favour of the popes and of the Roman Church , therefore Rome itself must have had the chief interest in a forgery executed for a purpose so clearly expressed However , it goes on to state , Grauert , for whom the forger is a Frankish subject , shares the view of Hergenr ther , i e the forger had in mind a defence of the new Western Empire from the attacks of the Eastern Romans Therefore it was highly important for him to establish the legitimacy of the newly founded empire , and this purpose was especially aided by all that the document alleges concerning the elevation of the pope Kirsch , Johann Peter Donation of Constantine The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol 5 New York Robert Appleton Company , 1909 Retrieved 1 November 2017 Gratian excluded it from his Decretum Later it was added as Palea It was also included in some collections of Greek canons As a forgery it currently carries no dogmatic or canonical authority , although it was previously used as such for hundreds of years in the past Is this a Papal title \? thumb right upright An example of a papal tiara Contrary to some claims , no tiara has ever been inscribed with the phrase Vicarius Filii Dei After the Donation of Constantine , the title Vicariuis Filii Dei appeared again in Our Sunday Visitor , a Catholic journal An article in the April 18 , 1915 , issue of Our Sunday Visitor had the following question and answer What are the letters on the Pope 's crown , and what do they signify , if anything \? The letters on the Pope 's crown are these Vicarius Filii Dei , which is a Latin for 'Vicar of the Son of God' Our Sunday Visitor , April 18 , 1915 , p 3 This has been used by some groups as evidence for the claim that the phrase appears on the papal tiara \( see below \) However , the writer of the article later withdrew his statements A rebuttal was mentioned in a 1922 edition of the journal The Pope claims to be the vicar of the Son of God , while the Latin words for this designation are not inscribed , as anti Catholics maintain , on the Pope 's tiara Our Sunday Visitor , 11 , No 14 , July 23 , 1922 The Protestant writer Andreas Helwig suggested that Vicarius Filii Dei was an expansion of the historical title Vicarius Christi , rather than an official title used by the Popes themselves His interpretation did not become common until about the time of the French Revolution Le Roy Edwin Froom \( 1948 \) Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers , vol 2 \( PDF \) , pp 605 608 Review and Herald Compare Ibid , p 649 vol 3 \( PDF \) , pp 228 , 242 Some later Protestant figures claimed that Vicarius Filii Dei was an official title of the Pope , with some saying that this title appeared on the papal tiara and or a mitre Catholic apologists answer the Protestant claims by noting that Vicarius Filii Dei has never been an official Papal title Patrick Madrid Pope Fiction Envoy magazine , March April 1998 Catholics answer the claims that Vicarius Filii Dei is written on the Papal Tiara by stating that a simple inspection of the more than 20 papal tiaras still in existence including those in use in 1866 during the reign of Pope Pius IX when Uriah Smith made his claim shows that none have this inscription , nor is there any evidence that any of the earlier papal tiaras destroyed by invading French troops in 1798 had it Protestant view Many Protestants have no view that Vicarius Filii Dei can be applied to the Bishop of Rome Origins of the controversy The earliest extant record of a Protestant writer on this subject is that of Professor Andreas Helwig in 1612 In his work Antichristus Romanus he took fifteen titles in Hebrew , Greek , and Latin and computed their numerical equivalents in those languages , arriving at the number 666 mentioned in the Book of Revelation Out of all these titles , he preferred to single out Vicarius Filii Dei , for the reason that it met all the conditions which Cardinal Bellarmine had thus far demanded Besides being in Latin , the title was not offensive or vile , but rather was honorable to this very one thumb The papal tiara given to Pope Pius IX by Queen Isabella II of Spain in the 1850s The tiara contains no writing Helwig suggested that the supposed title was an expansion of the historical title Vicarius Christi , rather than an official title used by the Popes themselves Additionally , he said nothing about the title appearing on tiaras or mitres Helwig 's interpretation did not become a common one until about the time of the French Revolution See Leroy Edwin Froom , Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers , vol 2 , pp 605 608 Compare Ibid , p 649 vol 3 , pp 228 , 242 Some later Protestant figures directly claimed that Vicarius Filii Dei was an official title of the Roman Catholic Pope , some claimed that this title appeared on the papal tiara and or a mitre Some Protestants view the Pope as the Antichrist This view was common at the time of Helwig and is still part of the confession of faith of some Protestant churches , such as those within Confessional Lutheranism A Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope , a Lutheran Confession in the Book of Concord Roman numerals Some Protestants identify the Roman Papacy with the Number of the Beast \( 666 \) from the book of Revelation , and believe that the phrase Vicarius Filii Dei , reduced to its Roman numerals , sums up to 666 , where U is taken as V \( two forms of V developed in Latin , which were both used for its ancestor U and modern V \) To produce 666 , the sum works as follows VICARIVS FILII DEI 5 1 100 1 5 1 50 1 1 500 1 666 Historical Seventh day Adventist views In 1866 , Uriah Smith was the first to propose the interpretation to the Seventh day Adventist Church Seventh day Adventist Bible Commentary , 223 See Review and Herald 28 196 , November 20 , 1866 In The United States in the Light of Prophecy , he wrote The pope wears upon his pontifical crown in jeweled letters , this title Vicarius Filii Dei , 'Viceregent of the Son of God' the numerical value of which title is just six hundred and sixty six The most plausible supposition we have ever seen on this point is that here we find the number in question It is the number of the beast , the papacy it is the number of his name , for he adopts it as his distinctive title it is the number of a man , for he who bears it is the 'man of sin' Uriah Smith , The United States in the Light of Prophecy Battle Creek , Michigan Seventh day Adventist Publishing Association \( 1884 \) , 4th edition , p 224 Uriah Smith maintained his interpretation in the various editions of Thoughts on Daniel and the Revelation , which was influential in the church In November 1948 , Le Roy Froom , a Seventh day Adventist ministerial leader , editor of the church 's Ministry \( magazine \) , and a church historian , wrote an article to correct the mistaken use of some of the denomination 's evangelists who continued to claim that the Latin words Vicarius Filii Dei were written on a papal tiara Froom continues in the article stating that a leading evangelist took photos of several tiaras in a trip to the Vatican and then , failing to find a tiara with the inscribed words , proceeded to add the words himself for use in his evangelistic preaching The evangelist then tried to include the image in a book on Bible prophecy that he was publishing in one of the church 's leading publishing houses in the United States However , the image was rejected by the publishing house and by the General Conference for being misleading However , some Adventist evangelists continue to make this claim Froom concludes his 1948 article with the following words Truth does not need fabrication to aid or support it Its very nature precludes any manipulation or duplicity We cannot afford to be party to any fraud The reflex action upon our own souls should be a sufficient deterrent We must never use a quotation or a picture merely because it sounds or looks impressive We must honor the truth , and meticulously observe the principle of honesty in the handling of evidence under all
