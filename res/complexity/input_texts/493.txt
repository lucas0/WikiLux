Arman \( November 17 , 1928 October 22 , 2005 \) , was a French born American artist Arman biography Born Armand Pierre Fernandez in Nice , France , Arman is a painter who moved from using the objects as paintbrushes \( allures d'objet \) to using them as the painting itself He is best known for his accumulations and destruction recomposition of objects Biography Arman 's father , Antonio Fernandez , an antiques dealer in Nice , was also an amateur artist and photographer , as well as a cellist From his father , Arman learned oil painting and photography After receiving his bachelor 's degree in philosophy and mathematics in 1946 , Arman began studying at the Ecole Nationale d'Art Decoratif in Nice He also began learning Judo at a police Judo School in Nice where he met the artists Yves Klein and Claude Pascal The trio would bond closely on a subsequent hitchhiking tour of the nations of Europe Completing his studies in 1949 , Arman enrolled as a student at the cole du Louvre in Paris , where he concentrated on the study of archaeology and oriental art In 1951 , Arman became a teacher at the Bushido Kai Judo School During this time he also served in the French military , completing his tour of duty as a medical orderly during the Indo Chinese War Early career Early in the development of his career , it was apparent that Arman 's concept of the accumulation of vast quantities of the same objects was to remain a significant component of his art Ironically , Arman had originally focused more attention on his abstract paintings , considering them to be of more consequence than his early accumulations of postage stamps Only when he witnessed viewer reaction to his first accumulation in 1959 did he fully recognize the power of such art In 1962 , he began welding together accumulations of the same kinds of metal objects , such as axes \( as pictured below \) left thumb 200px Avalanch \( 1990 \) , Tel Aviv University campos Inspiration and name change Inspired by an exhibition for the German Dadaist , Kurt Schwitters , in 1954 Arman began working on Cachets , his first major artistic undertaking At his third solo exhibition , held in Paris s Galerie Iris Clerc in 1958 , Arman unveiled his accumulation pieces les cachets These stamps on paper and fabric were to prove a success and were to provide an important change of course for the young artist s career Also in 1958 , Arman was signing with his first name as an homage to van Gogh , \( who signed his works Vincent \) chose to change the spelling of his name from to Arman On January 31 , 1973 , upon becoming a citizen of the United States , he officially changed his name to Armand Pierre Arman Arman chronology Nevertheless , he continued to use Arman as his public persona Evolution of work From 1959 1962 Arman developed his most recognizable style , beginning with his two most renowned concepts Accumulation and Poubelle Accumulations were collections of common and identical objects which he arranged in polyester castings or within Plexiglas cases His first welded accumulations were created in 1962 Arman chronology The Poubelles were collections of strewn refuse In 1960 , he filled the Galerie Iris Clert in Paris with garbage , creating Le Plein \( Full Up \) as a contrepoint of the exhibition called Le Vide at the same gallery two years earlier by his friend Yves Klein These works began to garner the attention of the European art community In October 1960 , together with Arman , Yves Klein , Fran ois Dufr ne , Raymond Hains , Martial Raysse , Daniel Spoerri , Jean Tinguely and Jacques Villegl , the art critic and philosopher Pierre Restany founded the group Nouveau r alisme , joined later by Cesar , Mimmo Rotella , Niki de Saint Phalle and Christo , the group of young artists defined themselves as bearing in common their new perspective approaches of reality They were reassessing the concept of art and the artist for a 20th Century consumer society by reasserting the humanistic ideals in the face of industrial expansion In 1961 , Arman made his debut in the United States , the country which was to become his home During this period , Arman explored creation via destruction The Coupes and the Col res featured sliced , burned or smashed objects arranged on canvas , often using objects with a strong identity such as music instruments or bronze statues Arman and Warhol Arman can be seen in Andy Warhol 's film Dinner at Daley 's , a documentation of a dinner performance by the Fluxus artist Daniel Spoerri that Warhol filmed on March 5 , 1964 Throughout his portrait screen test film , Arman sits in profile , looking down , appearing to be entranced in his reading , seemingly unaware of Warhol 's camera , only making small gestures , rubbing his eyes and licking the corner of his mouth He remained silent , eyes gazing over the pages of what seemed to be a newspaper , in this four minute 16mm black white reel Warhol owned two of Arman 's Poubelles and another accumulation called Amphetamines , which were put up for sale at Sotheby 's auction of the Andy Warhol Collection in May 1988 Move to New York City Enamored with the scene in New York , Arman took up residency in the city , just after his first exhibition at the Cordier Ekstrom In 1973 he would become an American citizen In New York , first at the Chelsea Hotel , and later at his more official studios , Arman began work on ever increasingly ambitious projects There were varied expansions of the Accumulations , their content included tools , watches , clocks , furniture , automobile parts , jewelry , and , of course , music instruments in various stages of dismemberment Musical instruments , specifically the stringsExample of a violin sculpture by Arman in the Everson Museum of Art , Syracuse , NY and the brass , would come to form a major constituent of Arman s oeuvre Of Arman 's accumulations , one of the largest is Long Term Parking , Image of Long Term Parking Detail of Long Term Parking which is on permanent display at the Chateau de Montcel in Jouy en Josas , France Completed in 1982 , the sculpture is an eighteen meter high accumulation of sixty automobiles
