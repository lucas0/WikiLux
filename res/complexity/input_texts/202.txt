Anti oppressive practice is an interdisciplinary approach primarily rooted within the practice of social work that focuses on ending socioeconomic oppression It requires the practitioner to critically examine the power imbalance inherent in an organizational structure with regards to the larger sociocultural and political context in order to develop strategies for creating an egalitarian environment free from oppression , racism , and other forms of discrimination in the larger society , by engaging at the legal and political level In general community practice it is about responding to oppression by dominant groups and individuals In social services it regulates any possible oppressive practices and helps in delivering welfare services in an inclusive manner Introduction Anti oppressive practice seeks to lessen \( starve the beast \) the exclusion of certain social groups from social equality , rights and social justice Social work generally is known to be a caring profession , but sometimes services provided that work for one person do not necessarily work for another or reflect the sensitivity required to work for another Related to this there may be a 'care versus control' issue , because where there is care there is responsibility , and therefore control and power which can lead to exclusions \( Humphries , 2004 , p105 \) Knowingly and deliberately causing discrimination to another constitutes an oppressive practice , the behavior also matters as much as intent The onus of the social worker is to show s he exercised due diligence according to generally accepted practices and conducts him herself in a manner generally accepted by society which constitutes as neutral ordinary humanity An imbalance in care and control of services may lead to oppression Lena Dominelli \( 2002 \) defines Oppression as , relations that divide people into dominant or superior groups and subordinate or inferior ones These relations of domination consist of the systematic devaluing of the attributes and contributions of those deemed inferior , and their exclusion from the social resources available to those in the dominant group The Exclusion \( E g Xenophobia \) that results from oppression or vice versa , can affect an individual or a system greatly This process is often evaluative , where the individual ends up measuring him herself in a hierarchy against the other based on the personal values s he holds Disposing to this , results in one 's identity or trait being regarded as superior to the other , thus creating an us them dynamic \( othering process \) resulting in division and which creates risk for oppression Lena Dominelli , Jo Campling \( 2002 \) Anti oppressive social work theory and practice Palgrave Macmillan The anti oppressive model In social work , the anti oppressive model aims to function and promote equal , non oppressive social relations between various identities Dominelli \( 2002 \) defines it , in challenging established truths about identity , anti oppressive practice seeks to subvert the stability of universalized biological representations of social division to both validate diversity and enhance solidarity based on celebrating difference amongst peoples \( p 39 \) It remains dedicated to principles of social justice , which is also upheld in NASW values , by acknowledging diversity within oppression and considering the intersection and hierarchies of the isms that construct people as victims or perpetrators The anti oppressive model analyzes and advocates against macro micro levels of oppression and emphasizes on social justice and social change along more empowering and emancipatory lines Dalrymple and Burke , 1995 The complex and unequal role of power and isms are considered as an immense complication in anti oppressive practice Those who benefit as in most relationships are those who with most power McNay , 1992 Thompson argues that there is essentially three stacks of barriers in anti oppressive practice They are personal \( P \) , cultural \( C \) and structural \( S \) P refers to personal and prejudice factors C refers to culture , commonalities , consensus and conformity S refers to Structural aspects like sociopolitical force or other social dimensions Thompson refers as P being embedded in C and C in S , interacting with each other in continuum Anti Oppressive Practice seeks to identify strategies to construct power in a way that will address the systemic inequalities that are operating simultaneously at the individual , group and institutional level , as opposed to producing and reproducing oppression Yee , J Y , H Wong A Janczur \( 2006 \) Examining systemic and individual barriers of ethno racial minority social workers in

Individual Oppression Personal Individual Oppression includes the values , beliefs and feelings held by individuals that affect interpersonal relationships According to Dominelli \( 2002 , p 6 \) , anti oppression is a methodology focusing on both process and outcome , and a way of structuring relationships between individuals that aim to empower users by reducing the negative effects of hierarchy in their immediate interaction and the work they do together Dominelli , L \( 2002 \) Anti oppressive practice in context \( 2ndedition \) In Social work themes , issues andcritical debates \( pp 1 19 \) New York , NY Palgrave Cultural Oppression Language has a contribution to oppression in general , language with its marking function constructs social structure and an interplay in creating cultural values Government records categorize people who are neither white or male , as ethnic presuming white people do not have an ethnicity but are the norm , and white people are often de raced in discourses Thompson , 2012 Structural Institutional Oppression In 2004 Humphries stated failure to critically analyse legislation 's and social policy led failure to identify the inherent racism within immigration systems Derek Clifford , Beverley Burke \( 2008 \) Anti Oppressive Ethics and Values in Social Work Palgrave Macmillan In community practices , anti oppressive practice functions to address problems that rise due to structural imbalance Herbert Marcuse defined the state as Law and order are always and everywhere the law and order which protect the established hierarchy it is nonsensical to invoke the absolute authority of this law and this order against those who suffer from it and struggle against it Professional practitioners are aware of the power \( im \) balance between service users and providers that reflects in practice , though the aim is always using this differences legitimately to empower others and reduce the experience of powerlessness and the resulting learned helplessness or the culture of silence Freire , 1972 Lois McNay in 1992 commented on this power \( im \) balance as Oppressions have always dominated on how our lives are lived , they are central to the profit base of the economy The big three of them are gender , race and class McNay cites exploitive division of labour as an example Social work solutions to the problems of oppressed groups must include policies that address all elements of oppression But Social workers also need to be aware that these efforts may not be necessarily supported by partners in the process of social justice Steve Myers , University of Salford , 2015 Nature Through anti oppressive practice social work practice focuses on a more emancipatory form of practice which locates the individual people and their family within their social contexts and helps them with structural patterns of the society that perpetuate inequalities through promotion of choices Thompson , 2011 Discussing issues in abbreviations and legal terms can be disempowering to clients and considered oppressive Speaking plainly and clearly is considered good working practice , where the client can not only understand but can become involved in making choices and decisions about their involvement with social services More specifically , anti oppression deals with the negative experience of people based on their race , their gender identity , sexual identity , their physical and mental ability , their choice of religion , their class background \( whether growing up poor , working poor , working , middle or upper class \) , their physical appearance \( fat or thin \) , and the list goes on It also is a way to challenge the ways people are treated based on these identities For example , when a woman is treated in a sexist way or a person of colour experiences racism Anti oppressive practice is about working with the service user to include them in facilitating a user led and user controlled service Healthy professional relationships will help build the confidence of the service user to enable them to develop their own ideas about their level of involvement Anti oppressive practice is a part of professional social work development schema They are bonded by this to develop counter hegemonic understanding of cross cultural and personal differences Clifford , 1994 Social work practitioners advocate against oppression by promoting increased respect for the inherent dignity and worth of all people , and social justice \( NASW , 1996 \) Acknowledging NASW values , along with the importance of human relationships , remains an integral part of building empowering client practitioner relationships \( NASW , 1996 \) Conclusion Anti oppressive practice is a current form of progressive social work which helps to identify psychosocial issues through an intersectional lens and act on the same It bridges the practice activism divide and leads the society in a transformative angle in human relations Its reformative call has opened eyes of both public and leading private management regimes and the principles resonates in effective and harmonic utilization of resources Anti oppressive practice does not compromise the established and traditional 1970s Anti Discriminatory Practice \( ADP \) which focuses on discrimination \( e g towards anti racist perspective \) whereas anti oppressive practice deals with processes of oppression and exclusion See also References Further reading External links An overview of AOP Donna Baines Useful concepts in Anti oppression Ontario Child
