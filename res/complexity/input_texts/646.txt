The Florida Miami football rivalry is an American college football rivalry between the Florida Gators football team of the University of Florida and Miami Hurricanes football team of the University of Miami The game was played annually from 1944 until 1987 , and is now played intermittently The winning team was formerly awarded the Seminole War Canoe Trophy Today , the round robin winner of the three biggest schools in the state of Florida \( either the Florida Gators , Florida State Seminoles or Miami Hurricanes \) receives the Florida Cup for beating the other two schools in the same season Florida won the most recent game in 2019 , 24 20 The two teams will have a home and home series in 2024 and 2025 Miami leads the series 29 27 Series history The Gators and Hurricanes played an annual home and away series for almost half a century beginning in 1938 except for 1944 , when Florida did not field a team during World War II The rivalry was once the most important in the state , as Miami and Florida were major college programs and began playing each other a decade before the Florida State Seminoles first took the field The yearly series ended in 1988 , when the Southeastern Conference \( SEC \) increased the number of conference games from six to seven Florida required six home football games to maintain funding levels for its athletic department , so the school decided to fill out its three game non conference schedule with two teams that did not require a home and home arrangement plus Florida State , ending the series with Miami Upon being hired as Florida 's head ball coach in 1990 , Steve Spurrier mentioned at his introductory press conference that he wanted to resume the annual series with Miami , and the schools actually signed a contract to play again beginning in 1992 However , the SEC increased the number of conference games to eight and added an SEC Championship Game that year , prompting Florida to cancel the agreement Given the explanation at the time of cancellation , many Canes fans remain skeptical , accusing the Gators of being afraid of losing , even though at the time , the two teams split the last six games and Miami 's only loss in their 1983 national title season was to Florida During his long tenure at Florida , former athletic director Jeremy Foley reiterated financial concerns as well as SEC expansion as reasons for not renewing the series on an annual basis , though he remained open to playing Miami in occasional neutral site games The Gators and Hurricanes have met on the gridiron seven times since the annual series ended , with Miami holding a 5 2 edge in those contests Four of those games were part of a regular season home and home agreement spread over 11 years and two were in bowl games The teams' next meeting will be a 2019 season opening neutral site game in Orlando The Seminole War Canoe Trophy was hand carved by Seminole Indians from a 200 year old cypress tree that was struck by lightning Donated on the behalf of Hollywood , Florida in 1950 , it has been an award given to the winner of football games between the schools The canoe was intended to be a representation of the fighting spirit of the Seminoles The trophy stopped being passed from school to school in the early 1970s both schools had trouble displaying the large wooden trophy After the final game in the home and home series in 1987 , the Seminole War Canoe Trophy was put on permanent display at the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame In 2011 , the University of Florida Student Government approved a resolution , which was sent to UM student body president Christina Farmer , ESPN and the head football coaches at each school , requesting the War Canoe 's return to UF since they had won the 2008 contest In response , Brandon Mitchell , president of the University of Miami 's Category 5 spirit club , replied The War Canoe was intended for the yearly rivalry and Miami won the final game of that yearly rivalry Miami kept the trophy and it remains at the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame The teams share a 19 19 record during the 38 game stretch of the War Canoe Trophy from 1950 to 1987 Florida

looking to break Jim Plunkett 's NCAA record for all time passing yardage in his last regular season game The Gators led the game throughout , and were up 45 8 when Reaves threw an interception to Miami 's defense with little time left in the game and 14 yards separating Reaves from the record After calling timeouts to prevent the Hurricanes from running out the clock , nearly the entire defense dropped down in unison and allowed Hurricanes back John Hornibrook to score Dubbed the Gator Flop , the play allowed the Gators to get the ball back so Reaves could break the record On the next drive Reaves would find Carlos Alvarez for a 15 yard gain to break the record , and after the game the entire Gators team jumped into the fountain at Miami Orange Bowl that was formerly used for the Miami Dolphins' live mascot Hurricanes coach Fran Curci refused to shake the hand of Gators coach Doug Dickey after the game for pulling a bush league stunt , though Dickey denied knowledge the
