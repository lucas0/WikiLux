The magainins are a class of antimicrobial peptides found in the African clawed frog \( Xenopus laevis \) They were independently discovered at around the same time by the labs of Michael Zasloff at the NIH and Dudley H Williams at the University of Cambridge The peptides are cationic , generally lack a stable conformation in water but form amphipathic helix in membranes their mechanism against micro organisms is unclear but they disrupt the cell membranes of a broad spectrum of bacteria , protozoa , and fungi Zasloff helped found a company , Magainin Pharmaceuticals \( subsequently called Genaera \) to develop magainins into drugs One candidate was an analog of magainin called pexiganan \( MSI 78 \) that the company developed as a topical agent for infected diabetic foot ulcers the FDA rejected the application due to lack of efficacy Another company , Dipexium Pharmaceuticals , ran further phase III clinical trials for the same use , which failed in 2016 References Category Antimicrobial peptides
