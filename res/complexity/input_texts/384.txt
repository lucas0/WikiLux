right thumb The Swedish Magicball is an example of a pseudoscientific washing ball product A laundry ball is a product that is promoted as a substitute for detergent Producers of laundry balls have been criticised for making pseudoscientific claims about how these balls work and the extent of their benefits The product is often sold by participants in multilevel marketing schemes While many people report that these balls work , the benefits may simply be comparable to washing without any detergent Most of the effect can be attributed to the mechanical effect of the ball or to using hot water instead of cold water Types of laundry ball There are several shapes of laundry balls laundry disks , globes , spheres or doughnuts The balls carry certain components inside , like ceramic pieces , magnetic material or activated water Manufacturers claim that these components have certain effects on washing efficacy , although studies do n't show any difference between the different types of balls Some balls also contain pellets of detergent or other ingredients Claimed benefits Laundry balls are marketed as cheaper , environmentally friendly alternatives to ordinary washing powders or liquids The claimed benefits include http www laundryball com au home php Lack of chemicals which may harm the environment Hypoallergenic and anti irritation Can be re used many times before refilling or replacing This can range from 60 to 2000 wash loads Reduced water usage \( because less rinsing is required this assumes the customer uses a different setting on their washing machine \) Reduced waste from packaging Reduced use of energy \( see embodied energy \) These benefits are comparable to the benefits of washing without any detergent How they claim to work Claims vary between products Some claims are not backed by science , while others are an exaggeration of benefits Balls which contain detergents may offer more cleaning power than water alone since their ingredients are comparable to normal washing powder , but in smaller quantities It is claimed that conventional washing powder manufacturers recommend using more powder than is necessary , and that these powders contain unnecessary fillers or fragrances Critics question whether the amount of detergent released by these balls is sufficient to generate significant cleaning effects Infrared and alkalization Some manufacturers claim that the components inside their balls emit far infrared rays , which are claimed to reduce the surface tension of water and facilitate washing The claim of emitting infrared is not false , as all materials emit far infrared waves at room temperature , in other words , heat radiation It is also true that heating reduces the surface tension of water , but the effect of the radiation emitted by the balls is negligible compared to the radiation emitted by the internal walls of the washing machine or by the water , specially if it 's hot water The claim of alkalization is dubious , while it is true that the alkaline agents in normal washing powders catalyze the tensides , there are no studies suggesting that the washing pearls would affect the pH of the water Anti chlorine properties Many products also claim that the balls contain anti chlorine agents which are supposed to neutralize chlorine which has been added to the tap water Chloride and bleach related substances are actually common in washing powders and chlorine is used in the disinfection of tap water The claims state that by removing chlorine from the washing water the surface tension is \( again \) reduced and harmful chlorine ca n't interact with the clothes , even though the amounts in tap water are very small both in Europe \( 0 3 1 0 ml l \) and North America \( 4 ml l \) Magnetic properties Magnetic water softeners claim that their magnetic fields can help remove scale from the washing machine and pipes , and prevent new limescale from adhering Some companies claim to remove hardness ions from water , or to precipitate the molecules in the water so they wo n't stick to the pipes The claims are dubious , the scientific basis is unclear , the working mechanism is vaguely defined and understudied , and high quality studies report negative results The reputation of these products is further damaged by the pseudoscientific explanations that promoters keep putting forward Some magnetic products claim that they minimize the size of the water molecule , a claim that has no scientific basis Negative ions Some manufacturers claim their products works by releasing negative ions which reduce the surface tension of water It is possible that OH ions , or hydroxide , could be created , but not in a large quantity Possible mechanisms of action The effect of the laundry balls is probably explained by simple mechanical action and by the usage of hotter water The mechanical action of the laundry balls can help clean some types of spots Some manufacturers claim that their products reduce energy consumption , but their pamphlets recommend using hot water Hot water will clean some types of spots better than cold water , leading some people to conclude that the balls worked Consumer protection In 1997 Trade Net , sold a laundry ball product \( the Blue Laundry Ball \) in various US states After complaints , their claims were investigated by consumer protection departments in Utah , Oregon and Florida , amongst others , and the company was prohibited from making certain claims , including that that such product cleans as well as conventional laundry detergent Trade Net offered a 'new' laundry ball product after this , but were forced to pay fines , including 190 , 000 to Oregon 's Department of Justice , 10 , 000 to Utah and then in April 1999 , 155 , 000 to the states of New York , Arizona , Arkansas , Hawaii , Idaho , Illinois , Michigan , Missouri , Nebraska , Nevada , Oklahoma and the FTC The company disappeared shortly after Sources In 2009 the Spanish consumer organization OCU made a study of ecobolas \( a type of laundry ball marketed in Spain \) It compared the efficacy of the laundry ball , normal detergent , and no detergent at all It concluded that laundry balls were no better than using just water , and it recommended that consumers simply use a minimum amount of detergent The Australian Consumers' Association published a report in the April 1998 issue of its magazine Choice It concluded that laundry balls were no better than cold water The Italian consumer association Altroconsumo carried a small test and concluded that laundry balls did n't wash better than plain water Some organizations recommending against their use are Consumers Union , International Fabricare Institute \( now called Drycleaning and Laundry Institute \) , Maytag , Soap and Detergent Association and Spanish OCU Multilevel marketing The product is often sold by participants in multilevel marketing schemes See also Soap nuts
