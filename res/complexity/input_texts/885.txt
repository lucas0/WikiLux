Karen Lucia Gomez Dumpit Gwendolyn Pimentel Gana Leah Tanodra Armamento Roberto Eugenio Cadiz June 18 , 2015 Incumbent Controversies Tenure of Chairperson and Commissioners In a Press briefing on July 27 , 2017 , Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella claimed that the CHR Chairperson and its commissioners serve at the pleasure of the president and that they may be replaced at the President 's pleasure This claim was based on the Executive Order No 163 A \( issued during the presidency of Corazon Aquino in 1987 \) that amended the Section 2 , Sub Paragraph \( c of Executive Order No 163 , stating that The Chairman and Members of the Commission on Human Rights shall beappointed by the President Their tenure in office shall be at the pleasure of the President However , the said executive order was questioned in the Supreme Court in the case Bautista v Salonga , G R No 86439 on April 13 , 1989 leading to the declaration of the said executive order as unconstitutional Taking a quote from the said Supreme Court ruling , Indeed , the Court finds it extremely difficult to conceptualize how an office conceived and created by the Constitution to be independent as the Commission on Human Rights and vested with the delicate and vital functions of investigating violations of human rights , pinpointing responsibility and recommending sanctions as well as remedial measures therefor , can truly function with independence and effectiveness , when the tenure in office of its Chairman and Members is made dependent on the pleasure of the President Executive Order No 163 A , being antithetical to the constitutional mandate of independence for the Commission on Human Rights has to be declared unconstitutional CHR as a Constitutional Office Under the Article IX of the 1987 Constitution , three constitutional commissions were established namely the Commission on Elections \( COMELEC \) , the Civil Service Commission \( CSC \) , and the Commission on Audit \( COA \) The Commission on Human Rights \( CHR \) , on the other hand , was created under the Article XIII , Section 17 of the 1987 constitution and the Administrative Code of 1987 In a Resolution of the Supreme Court contained in G R No 155336 , it ruled that the CHR is a constitutional body enjoying limited fiscal autonomy External links References Human Rights Category Human rights organizations based in
