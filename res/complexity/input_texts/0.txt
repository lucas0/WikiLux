right 300px thumb Sir Thomas White 's Rd , Chapelfields \( view looking north \) Chapelfields \( also written Chapel Fields \) is a suburb of Coventry , West Midlands , England It is situated about 1 5 miles to the west of Coventry City Centre bordering Coundon to the north , Earlsdon to the south , Spon End to the east and Whoberley to the west It is mainly residential , with a high proportion of graduates among the younger residents , and nowadays a significant element of students , particularly those studying at the University of Warwick Houses in Chapelfields proper are mostly small to medium terraced houses suitable for families The area properly speaking comprises just nine streets Queensland Avenue , Craven Street , Sir Thomas White 's Road , Mount Street , Lord Street , Duke Street , the easternmost stub of Abercorn Road , the southern side of Allesley Old Road , and the northern side of Hearsall Lane however , most maps show the area as including a number of other streets to the west of Queensland Avenue , and the residents of those streets and estate agents generally consider them to be part of Chapelfields , though they are not considered so by the Chapelfields Area Residents and Traders Association \( CARTA \) In mediaeval times there was a lazar house or leper hospital covering part of the area , which had been founded in 1168 by one Hugh Kevelioc , Earl of Chester , for William D'Auney , a knight who had been one of Kevelioc 's followers in a crusade , where he had contracted the condition The modern area originates in 1847 when it began to be built to accommodate the watch making industry for which Coventry was then famous , as an extension of the neighbouring Spon area however , the part of Chapelfields from Sir Thomas White 's Road to Queensland Avenue was not developed until the early 20th century \( Sir Thomas White 's Road itself was built in 1908 and formed part of the tram route to Broadgate \) It is a quirk of this section of Chapelfields that properties there are subject to restrictive covenants forbidding their use for fried fish shops , which were extremely prevalent in the area at that time Another particularly prevalent type of business in Chapelfields has always been the public house Though fewer in number than they once were , there are still seven licenced premises in this tiny area the Craven Arms , the Chestnut Tree , the Hearsall Inn , the Coombe Abbey Inn , the Craven Club \( all in Craven Street \) the Four Provinces \( Allesley Old Road , on the corner with Craven Street \) and the Nursery Tavern in Lord Street The last , locally noted as a real ale pub , presumably derives its name from Weare 's Nursery , the immediate former user of the land upon which Chapelfields was built Chapelfields pubs no longer extant included the New Inn and the Brewer 's Arms in Craven Street , and the Sun Dial in Lord Street Adjacent to the area is Hearsall Common , an open space that was deprived of official common status by the local authority in 1927 In 2007 08 this became the centre of dispute between some local residents who opposed the Council 's plans to remove part of the Chapelfields end of the common for bus lanes as part of the PrimeLines scheme The six Conservative councillors of the Earlsdon and Whoberley wards have refused to support the objections and are backing one of their number , council leader Ken Taylor , in his attempts to impose this scheme which is the brainchild of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive 1 , 928 local residents signed a petition against the scheme The matter has not been settled at the time of writing , nor are applications by local residents to have the Common officially recognised as a village green to protect it References Category Suburbs of Coventry
