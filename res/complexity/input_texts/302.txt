What if I brought somebody into the world in the wrong year \? In 1890 Tarbell moved to Paris to do post graduate work and write a biography of Madame Roland , the leader of an influential salon during the French Revolution While in France , she wrote articles for various magazines , catching the eye of publisher Samuel McClure , earning her the position of editor for the magazine She went to work for McClure 's Magazine and wrote a popular series on Napoleon Bonaparte Her twenty part Judith and William Serrin Muckraking ! The Journalism that Changed America New York The New York Press , 2002 series on Abraham Lincoln doubled the magazine 's circulation , and was published in a book These gave her a national reputation as a leading writer and made her the leading authority on the slain president Her research in the backwoods of Kentucky and Illinois uncovered the true story of Lincoln 's childhood and youth and chronicled his rise to the presidency Tarbell 's influence on the oil industry In 1900 , Tarbell began to research the Standard Oil trust with the help of assistant , John Siddal Judith and William Serrin Muckraking ! The Journalism that Changed America New York The New York Press , 2002 Tarbell began her interviews with Henry H Rogers Rogers had begun his career during the American Civil War in western Pennsylvania oil regions where Tarbell had grown up In 1902 , she conducted detailed interviews with the Standard Oil magnate Rogers , wily and normally guarded in matters related to business and finance , may have been under the impression her work was to be complimentary He was apparently unusually forthcoming However , Tarbell 's interviews with Rogers formed the basis for her negative expos of the ingenious business practices of industrialist John D Rockefeller and the massive Standard Oil organization Her work , which became known at the time as muckraking \( now called investigative journalism \) , first ran as a series of articles in McClure 's Magazine , which were later published together as a book , The History of the Standard Oil Company in 1904 Tarbell 's biggest obstacle , however , was neither her gender nor Rockefeller 's opposition Rather , her biggest obstacle was the craft of journalism She proposed to investigate Standard Oil and Rockefeller by using documents hundreds of thousands of pages scattered throughout the nation then fleshing out her findings through well informed interviews with the company 's current and former executives , competitors , government regulators , antitrust lawyers , and academic experts Columbia Journalism Review And then , in an inspirational tale for journalists , Ida Tarbell went to work Her History of the Standard Oil Company spotlighted Rockefeller 's practices and mobilized the public Readers nationwide awaited each chapter of the story , serialized in 19 installments by McClure 's between 1902 and 1904 USAToday com Tarbell 's look into the oil industry is known to have reinvented investigative reporting Columbia Journalism Review Her stories on Standard Oil began in the November 1902 issue of McClure 's and lasted for nineteen issues She was meticulous in detailing Rockefeller 's early interest in oil and how the industry began After the series was over , she wrote a profile of Rockefeller perhaps the first CEO profile ever More than simply a muckraker , Tarbell developed investigative reporting tactics , digging into public documents across the country Separately , these documents provided individual instances of Standard Oil 's strong arm tactics against rivals , railroad companies , and others that got in its way Collected by Tarbell into a cogent history , they became a damning portrayal of big business Indeed , a subhead on the cover of Weinberg 's book encapsulates it this way How a female investigative journalist brought down the world 's greatest tycoon and broke up the Standard Oil monopoly Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly Tarbell 's reporting and writing of Standard Oil stood above everything else for two reasons It was the first corporate coverage of its kind , and it attacked the business operations of Rockefeller , the best known CEO in the country at the time That a prominent person in American society could lead a company that used such unsavory operating tactics was eye opening Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly thumb right Ida M Tarbell , 1904 She didn t like the label Muckraker and wrote an article Muckraker or Historian where she justified her efforts for exposing the oil trust She referred to this classification of muckraker , which I did not like All the radical element , and I numbered many friends among them , were begging me to join their movements I soon found that most of them wanted attacks They had little interest in balanced findings Now I was convinced that in the long run the public they were trying to stir would weary of vituperation , that if you were to secure permanent results the mind must be convinced She exposed Rockefeller 's ruthless tactics and their destructive effect on smaller oil businesses Her articles failed to mention that her brother ran a competing oil company , the Pure Oil Company Tarbell 's expos fueled negative public sentiment against Standard Oil and was a contributing factor in the U S government 's antitrust actions against the Standard Oil Trust Company Death and legacy Tarbell died of pneumonia at Bridgeport Hospital in Bridgeport , Connecticut on January 6 , 1944 after being in the hospital since December 1943 She was 86 http www nytimes com learning general onthisday bday 1105 html The Ida Tarbell House was declared a National
