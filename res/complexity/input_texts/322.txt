thumb upright 1 4 right SSDs with U 2 interface U 2 , formerly known as SFF 8639 , is a computer interface standard for connecting SSDs to a computer It covers the physical connector , electrical characteristics , and communication protocols It uses up to four PCI Express lanes and two SATA lanes It was developed for the enterprise market and designed to be used with new PCI Express drives along with SAS and SATA drives History The Enterprise SSD form factor was developed by the SSD Form Factor Working Group \( SFFWG \) The specification was released on December 20 , 2011 , as a mechanism for providing PCI Express connections to SSDs for the enterprise market Goals included being usable in existing 2 5 and 3 5 mechanical enclosures , to be hot swappable and to allow legacy SAS and SATA drives to be mixed using the same connector family In June 2015 the SFFWG announced that the connector was being renamed to U 2 Connector The U 2 connector is mechanically identical to the SATA Express device plug , but provides four PCI Express lanes through a different usage of available pins U 2 devices may be connected to an M 2 port using an adapter Availability In November 2015 , Intel introduced their 750 series which came in both PCI Express and U 2 variants U 2 compared with M 2 U 2 allows hot swap and M 2 does not U 2 can use 3 3V or 12V for power , while M 2 only supports 3 3V As implemented While the U 2 standard does not imply anything about the form factor of the device that uses it , in practice U 2 is used only on 2 5 SSDs , so a choice between 2 5 and M 2 form factors is implicitly a choice between U 2 and M 2 interfaces 2 5 drives are easier to keep cool than an M 2 drive Most 2 5 drives use their incorporated enclosure as a large heatsink but most M 2 drives come with no heatsink 2 5 drives are able to sustain higher speeds for a longer duration than M 2 drives due to earlier thermal throttling of M 2 drives Since M 2 drives typically have no heatsink and are not able to be positioned in a location with ideal airflow , they are more likely to suffer from thermal throttling than a 2 5 drive While a drive is suffering from thermal throttling , which is necessary to protect the drive from damage , it slows down the drive 's performance This means the drive is no longer providing its advertised speed Some M 2 drives may only be able to provide their advertised speeds for brief durations before thermal throttling slows them down 2 5 drives can have higher storage capacities than M 2 drives Since 2 5 drives are physically larger than M 2 drives , it is easier for the manufacturer to place more flash storage chips on them References Category Computer buses Category Computer connectors
