thumb Northrop Grumman AN AAQ 24 DIRCM Directional Infrared Counter Measures \( DIRCM \) is a system produced by Leonardo , Elbit Systems , Northrop Grumman , ITT Corporation , and BAE Systems to protect aircraft from infrared homing \( heat seeking \) man portable missiles It is a lightweight , compact system designed to provide mission vulnerable aircraft with increased protection from common battlefield threats It is more advanced than conventional infrared countermeasures The term DIRCM is used as a generic term to describe any infrared countermeasure system that tracks and directs energy toward the threat , as in the Russian 101KS O Method of operation The system uses an active method of jamming of infrared missile seekers through the sensor aperture The system can be placed in either active or standby mode In the standby mode the aircrew must select the active mode to begin jamming IR threats The pulsing flashes of IR energy confuse the missile guidance system AN AAQ 24 Nemesis The AN AAQ 24 system is a directional infrared countermeasure \( DIRCM \) system It consists of a missile warning system \( AN AAR 54 \) , an integration unit , a processor , and laser turrets \( Small Laser Transmitter Assembly , SLTA \) Early versions used an arc lamp to generate the jamming signal Newer versions produced by Northrop Grumman use diode based pump systems are known by the GUARDIAN name , and could be fitted to many commercial carriers in the near future pending the completion of many tests on the viability of such options It will be installed on C 17 Globemaster III , MC 130 , CV 22 , and the CH 53E Super Stallion The system is also the basis for the Northrop Grumman Guardian system marketed for commercial aircraft Large Aircraft Infrared Counter Measure system \( LAIRCM \) was a requirement for protecting Large Aircraft from infrared guided missiles The solution for this requirement is the AN AAQ 24 Nemesis system Also , LAIRCM Lite is a C 17 program that uses a combination of laser jammers and flares due to the limited availability of LAIRCM components See also AN ALQ 144 Infrared guided missile countermeasure system Civil Aircraft Missile Protection System Common Infrared Countermeasures program Flight Guard Infrared countermeasure , first type of countermeasures Missile approach warning system Northrop Grumman Guardian References Global Security GOES 15 External links AN AAQ 24 \( V \) DIRCM \( Directional Infrared Countermeasure \) Category Infrared imaging Category Missile countermeasures Category Military electronics of the United States
