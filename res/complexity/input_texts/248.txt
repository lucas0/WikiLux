In GUI based application software , a ribbon is an interface where a set of toolbars are placed on tabs in a tab bar Recent releases of some Microsoft applications have embraced this form with an intricate modular ribbon as their main interface The Ribbon is a contextual interface that offers functionality based on the context the user is working in The Ribbon GUI provides the user interface of an application with a large toolbar filled with graphical representations of control elements which are grouped by different functionality The Ribbon can also contain tabs to expose different sets of control elements eliminating the need for a lot of different icon based tool bars Background on the Ribbon interface Although prior to 2006 interfaces might have existed that looked like the Ribbon GUI , the term Ribbon was introduced with the betas of Microsoft Office 2007 In previous versions of Microsoft Office , the GUI had become quite complex to the point where some called it bloated , with long menus and large toolbars , according to Microsoft 's authors In Office 2000 2003 , the interface overload was dealt with by creating adaptive menus and rafted tool bars These however proved to add to complexity by making the interface less predictable and made it harder to find required complex functionality \( in Office 2007 , the non ribbon GUI was switched off \) An Office Assistant was introduced which did not improve the usability of the GUI This led to the development of a new contextual interface which shows those commands most relevant for the task being done Ribbons in Microsoft software Microsoft originally implemented ribbons as part of its Fluent User Interface in Office 2007 Office Fluent User Interface The ribbon is formed as a panel that houses certain command buttons and icons it organizes commands as a set of tabs , each grouping relevant commands Each application has a different set of tabs which house the options for that specific application Within each tab , various related options may be grouped together The Ribbon can be minimized by double clicking the active tab The ribbon consolidates the functionality previously found in menus , toolbars and many task panes into one area The Microsoft Office Fluent user interface overview Retrieved 2009 05 24 In Microsoft Office 2007 the Ribbon interface was limited to the main Word , Excel and PowerPoint applications but in Microsoft Office 2010 the Ribbon will be introduced across all Office applications The ribbon UI has also begun to be implemented in other Microsoft software like Windows , SQL Server and Dynamics CRM 5 0 The Windows 7 applications Paint and WordPad now utilize a ribbon based UI Other software developers Since the introduction of the Ribbon GUI interface in Microsoft Office 2007 there has been an uptake of this type of interface in applications created by other developers especially those creating tools for Microsoft related products Some examples from a 2008 GUI showcase report SQL diagnostic manager \( mixed Menu bar Ribbon GUI \) Fotoflexer \( webbased Ribbon GUI \) OpenOffice experiments In 2008 OpenOffice org started the project Renaissance to improve the user interface of OpenOffice So far the prototypes of the project are frequently seen as similar to the ribbon interface , but this has resulted in some criticism from users Reaction to interface At the introduction of the Ribbon interface in Microsoft Office the reception of the Ribbon GUI by users and experts was mixed Generally it was seen as an improvement especially for new users For advanced and power users , the adjustment has been at least in part more disconcerting It can take a greater number of mouse clicks or keyboard tapping to perform simple tasks , and no adjustments were possible in Office 2007 This is no longer true in Office 2010 , which does allow ribbon customization Ribbon user interface licensing On 2006 November 21 , Microsoft announced a licensing program for the intellectual property of Office 2007 user interface , including the ribbon GUI element The license is royalty free to any product , as long as it does not directly compete with Microsoft Office applications Word , Excel , PowerPoint , Outlook , or Access Similar to open standards licensing , licensees also must conform to the required sections of the licensed user interface guidelines in order to stay within the letter of the license The design guidelines document is only available after signing a non disclosure agreement with Microsoft Microsoft employee Jensen Harris You can use the UI in open source projects as long as the license terms are consistent with our license According to interpretation by Groklaw editor Pamela Jones , the licensing terms are not compatible with any OSI certified open source license , because Microsoft 's license agreement does not allow sublicensing allthough non sublicensable patent licenses are required in normal use for open standards like World Wide Web Consortium \( W3C \) standards W3C royalty free licensing requires non sublicensable patent license Similar user interfaces from the past KDE developer Jaros aw Staniek notes that the ribbon concept has historically appeared extensively as tabbed toolbars in applications such as Macromedia HomeSite , Dreamweaver and Borland Delphi He also argues that the new user interface wastes muscle memory of people who are already familiar with the old UI , and that words \( like menus \) can convey complicated actions better than ribbon icons See also Tab
