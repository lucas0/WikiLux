Associated Press photographer The photo \( captioned General Nguyen Ngoc Loan executing a Viet Cong prisoner in Saigon \) and film became two famous images in contemporary American journalism Career Loan was a staunch South Vietnamese nationalist , refusing to give Americans special treatment in his jurisdiction For example , he rejected the arrest of a Vietnamese mayor by American military police and insisted that only South Vietnamese authorities could arrest and detain South Vietnamese citizens He also insisted that U S civilians , including journalists , fell under South Vietnamese jurisdiction while in Saigon Loan 's uncompromising stand caused him to be regarded as a troublemaker by the Presidency of Lyndon B Johnson Loan was also skeptical of the U S CIA backed Phoenix Program to attack and neutralize the clandestine Vi t C ng infrastructure Robbins , pp 94 104 Loan 's men were also involved in the arrest of two Vi t C ng operatives who had been engaged in sending out peace feelers to U S officials behind the back of the South Vietnamese His stand against such backdoor dealing , and his opposition to releasing one of the communist negotiators , reportedly angered the Americans , and forced them to keep both him and the South Vietnamese better informed of diplomatic dealings involving their country Loan was an accomplished pilot he led an airstrike on Vi t C ng forces at B p in 1967 , shortly before he was promoted to permanent brigadier general rank The Americans were displeased at his promotion , and Loan submitted his resignation shortly thereafter According to the 2010 book It was widely believed that Loan was being forced out by the Americans for exposing their dealings with the VC or that he was taking a stand on principle because the U S was trying to compel the government to release communist envoy Sau Ha Robbins , pp 105 106 The South Vietnamese cabinet subsequently rejected Loan 's resignation The United States under the Nixon administration later negotiated a separate deal with the North that left communist troops in good tactical position within South Vietnam , and forced acquiescence by the South Vietnamese Later action by the U S Congress cut off aid to South Vietnam during the final northern conquest in 1975 Prisoner execution General Nguyen Ngoc Loan Executing a Viet Cong Prisoner in Saigon is a photograph

Harper 's magazine April 1972 , Page 69 in front of AP photographer Eddie Adams and NBC News television cameraman V S u The photograph and footage were broadcast worldwide , galvanizing the anti war movement The execution appalled many people , but was most likely legal as L m was acting like a franc tireur According to Article 4 of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 , irregular forces are entitled to prisoner of war status provided that they are commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates , have a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance , carry arms openly , and conduct their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war If they do not meet all of these , they may be considered francs tireurs \( in the original sense of illegal combatant \) and punished as criminals in a military jurisdiction , which may include summary execution L m had murdered a POW and civilians thus violating the rules of war He was not marked by any identifiable marker showing that he was a legal combatant The photo won Adams the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography , though he later regretted its effect The image became an anti war icon Concerning Loan and his famous photograph , Adams wrote in Time The general killed the Viet Cong I killed the general with my camera Still photographs are the most powerful weapon in the world People believe them , but photographs do lie , even without manipulation They are only half truths What the photograph did n't say was , What would you do if you were the general at that time and place on that hot day , and you caught the so called bad guy after he blew away one , two or three American soldiers \?
