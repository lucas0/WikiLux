addressed the audience giving them his support The official representative of kripari read a list of requests to the authorities of West Herzegovina county The protesters left after a speech by Stanko korba , the president of the Union of handicapped people from the Homeland war korba told them that the ministry of internal affairs has accepted to look into their requests Although , he said , that does not mean that the Ministry necessarily sees these complaints as valid The council of iroki Brijeg also held an extraordinary meeting The counselors made a declaration denouncing the violence that occurred The protests were repeated the same week There were between 13 , 000 and 15 , 000 protesters Besides citizens of iroki Brijeg the fans of Croat dominated clubs from Mostar , Tomislavgrad , Livno , ep e , Kiseljak , Posavina and a number of people from Croatia attended Representatives of kripari demanded the resignation of Mirsad Kebo and Zvonimir Juki Sarajevo In Sarajevo , members of

10 , 000 citizens They alleged that the causes for violence started even before they entered the town of iroki Brijeg in the form of provocations by local residents shouting ethnic slurs at them and gross negligence by the iroki Brijeg police which split them up into small unprotected groups and completely ignored any misconduct on the side of the kripari up to and including doing nothing to stop the kripari from hurling rocks at them The supporters of many other Bosnian clubs present during the demonstrations have also reported that they were subject to similar ethnic provocations and willful police neglect when visiting Western Herzegovina They also expressed shock at the fact that as soon as physical confrontations broke out between them and the kripari , the police started attacking members of Horde Zla in unison with kripari and other local residents instead of doing their job of separating them They demanded a thorough investigation into the misconduct of the iroki Brijeg police force which later confirmed that multiple policemen have been aiding and abetting assaults on members of Horde Zla including , in the case of policeman Dragan Vujovi , being accomplices to murder They also accused the police of ignoring local residents who had been shooting automatic weapons at the members of Horde Zla as in the case of Oliver Knezevi who can be seen holding an AK 47
