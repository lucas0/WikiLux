Plastic bag regulation The ACC has engaged repeatedly in fighting governmental restrictions and bans on plastic shopping bags The phase out of lightweight plastic bags has been proposed or implemented in many countries since 2002 In the United States , in July 2008 , the Seattle City Council voted to impose an additional 20 cent fee on each plastic bag purchased from stores by shoppers as a convenience for transportation of goods This effort was suspended until a referendum could be held in 2009 , allowing voters a chance to weigh in on the issue of whether they should continue to be encouraged to support industry by purchasing plastic bags without considering disposal costs During the period leading up to the referendum vote the American Chemistry Council stepped into this local affair , ultimately spending some 1 4 million on their successful effort to thwart the proposed system of fully accounting for the cost of plastic bags Seattle in 2012 overcame ACC objections and successfully enacted a bag ban In 2010 the ACC was quoted by The New York Times in opposition to a California bill to outlaw plastic bags , claiming that new law amounts to a 1 billion tax added to Californian 's grocery bills But subsequent ACC efforts to prevent adoption of municipal ordinances banning plastic bags have not been successful Over ACC opposition , San Jose , California , in 2010 adopted California 's strictest ban The ordinance , in effect since 2012 , prohibits supermarkets , pharmacies , corner shops and others from distributing single use plastic bags , with fines for violations Retailers can sell paper bags made of 40 percent recycled materials for 10 cents each , gradually increasing to 25 cents by 2014 In 2016 , California voters approved a statewide ban on carry out plastic bags See also American Council on Science and Health American Chemical Society References External links AmericanChemistry com \( official website \) PlasticsMythBuster org \( another American Chemistry Council site \) Responsible Care Global Initiative Lobby Watch The Center for Public Integrity ACC profile BisphenolA \( another site owned by American Chemistry \) Category Business organizations based in the United States Category Chemistry trade associations Category Organizations based in Arlington County , Virginia Category 1872 establishments in the United States Category Scientific organizations established in 1872
