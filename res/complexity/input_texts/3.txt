all with the one that existed after 1992 It largely corresponded to the later Michigan 's 2nd congressional district , covering most of the west coast counties starting with Muskegon and taking in a portion of Grand Traverse County It also included about half of Ottawa County , Montcalm County , half of Ionia County , and two eastern townships of Kent County , Michigan The district from 1992 to 2002 was largely based in Pontiac and Flint essentially , the successor of the old 7th District The strong Democratic voting record in Flint and Pontiac compensated for the largely Republican leaning of most of the rest of the district 's area In 2002 , this district essentially became the 5th District , while the 9th was reconfigured to take in most of the Oakland County portion of the old 11th District The only areas that survived in the 9th congressional district across the 2002 redistricting were Pontiac , Waterford , Auburn Hills , some of Orion Township , Oakland Township , Rochester and Rochester Hills This district was for all intents and purposes the one eliminated by the 2012 redistricting Portions of it were reassigned to four different districts , all of which largely preserved other former districts The current 9th is mostly the successor of the old 12th District Andy Levin was elected on November 6th and is congressman Cities , townships , and villages Cities
