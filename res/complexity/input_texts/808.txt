A nanowire battery uses nanowires to increase the surface area of one or both of its electrode s Two designs , variations of the lithium ion battery have been announced , although neither is commercially available Both replace the traditional graphite anode Silicon One design uses a stainless steel anode covered in silicon nanowires Silicon stores ten times more lithium than graphite , offering increased energy density The large surface area increases the anode 's power density , allowing for fast charging and high current delivery The anode was invented at Stanford University in 2007 Silicon anodes had been dismissed because they tended to crack and become unusable , because it swelled by 400 intercalating lithium during charging In September 2010 , researchers demonstrated 250 charge cycles maintaining above 80 percent of initial storage capacity Commercialization was originally expected to occur in 2012 , but was later deferred to 2014 A related company , Amprius , shipped a related device with silicon and other materials in 2013 Canonical announced on July 22 , 2013 , that its Ubuntu Edge smartphone would contain a silicon anode lithium ion battery Germanium An anode using germanium nanowire was claimed to have the ability to increase the capacity and lifetimes of lithium ion batteries Like silicon , germanium expands during charging and disintegrates after a small number of cycles The anodes were claimed to retain capacities of 900 mAh g after 1100 cycles , even at discharge rates of 20 100C This performance was attributed to a restructuring of the nanowires that occurs within the first 100 cycles to form a mechanically robust , continuously porous network Once formed , the restructured anode loses only 0 01 of capacity per cycle thereafter See also List of emerging technologies Nanoball batteries References External links Graphene Silicon Anodes for Li ion Batteries Go Commercial XGS presents new silicon graphene anode materials for lithium ion batteries Category American inventions Category Emerging technologies Category Lithium ion batteries Category Nanoelectronics Category Rechargeable batteries
