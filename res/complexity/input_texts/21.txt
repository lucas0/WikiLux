Ray tracing hardware is special purpose computer hardware designed for accelerating ray tracing calculations Introduction Ray tracing and rasterization The problem of rendering 3D graphics can be conceptually presented as finding all intersections between a set of primitives \( typically triangles or polygons \) and a set of rays \( typically one or more per pixel \) Introduction to real time

Ray Tracing \( Definitions \) graphics cg uni saarland de Up to 2010 all typical graphic acceleration boards , called graphics processing units \( GPUs \) , use rasterization algorithms The ray tracing algorithm solves the rendering problem in a different way In each step , it finds all intersections of a ray with a set of relevant primitives of the scene Both approaches have their own benefits and drawbacks Rasterization can be performed using devices based on a stream computing model , one triangle at the time , and access to the complete scene is needed only once The drawback of rasterization is that non local effects , required for an accurate simulation of a scene , such as reflections and shadows are difficult and refractionsChris Wyman 's Research Interactive Refractions Department of Computer Science at The University of Iowa , www cs uiowa edu nearly impossible to compute The ray tracing algorithm is inherently suitable for scaling by parallelization of individual ray renders SaarCOR A Hardware Architecture for Ray Tracing , J rg Schmittler , Ingo Wald , Philipp Slusallek , Section 2 , Previous work However anything other than ray casting requires recursion of the ray tracing algorithm \( and random access to the scene graph \) to complete their analysis , SaarCOR A Hardware Architecture for Ray Tracing , J rg Schmittler , Ingo Wald , Philipp Slusallek , Section 3 , The Ray Tracing Algorithm since reflected , refracted , and scattered rays require that various parts of the scene be re accessed in a way not easily predicted But it can easily compute various kinds of physically correct effects , providing much more realistic impression than rasterization The complexity of a well implemented ray tracing algorithm scales logarithmically this is due to objects \( triangles and collections of triangles \) being placed into BSP trees or similar structures , and only being analyzed if a ray intersects with the bounding volume of the binary space

Graphics company website www caustic com have produced a plug in card , the CausticOne \( 2010 \) , that accelerates global illumination and other ray based rendering processes when coupled to a PC CPU and GPU The hardware is designed to organize scattered rays \( typically produced by global illumination problems \) into more coherent sets \( lower spatial or angular spread \) for further processing by an external processor Reinventing Ray Tracing 15 7 2009 , Jonathan Erickson interview with James McCombe of Caustic Graphics , www drdobbs com Imagination Technologies , after acquiring Caustic Graphics , produced the Caustic Professional 's R2500 and R2100 plug in cards containing RT2 ray trace units \( RTUs \) Each RTU was capable of calculating up to 50 million incoherent rays per second Nvidia , partnering with Microsoft DirectX , announced the Nvidia RTX developer library in 2018 , which promised fast real time ray tracing solutions powered by hardware accelerated ray tracing \( ASIC tensor cores \) found in the new Volta generation GPUs In September 2018 Nvidia introduced the Turing microarchitecture with its RTX 2000 series cards , bringing real time ray tracing to
