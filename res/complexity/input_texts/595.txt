known as 68W , the MOS was changed effective October 1 , 2006 Formerly known by the MOS codes 91B \( 91 Bravo \) and 91A \( 91 Alpha \) with 91A employed since the Vietnam War The Department of the Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel issued a notice for future change for the MOS 91B and 91C \( Licensed Practical Nurse \) in September 1999 The notice established the transition to 91W to begin on 1 October 2001 and end on 30 September 2007 The 91W MOS required additional training and the maintenance of civilian EMT certification which was until that point optional for soldiers During that period all 91B C were given the identifier of Y2 until they completed the additional training to become 91W Failure to transition resulted in some medics having to reclassify into another MOS Later as part of an administrative revision of MOS 's MOS 91W was renamed 68W Training After completion of basic combat training , soldiers training for 68W10 ship to Fort Sam Houston , Texas for Advanced Individual Training \( AIT \) The AIT or job training may last for 16 to 68 weeks , depending what additional skill training is completed Training includes a combination of lecture , hands on , and practical field exercises with many skills including starting intravenous lines practiced on each other The first part of the course focuses on CPR and EMT Basic training and concludes with certification tests for both skills Further training is on Army specific tasks After assignment to a unit , 68Ws may , at the request of their unit 's Physician Assistant \( PA \) , attend any number of advanced topics Topics are generally prescribed per each unit 's functional role For example , front line combat medic \( aka line medic \) may learn about advanced trauma treatments including venous cutdowns , placement of chest tubes , or use of specialty hemorrhage control methods such as Chitosan patches In the case of those attached to medical units , they may learn to administer medications which result in more definitive treatment than their civilian counterparts are allowed to Unlike civilian hospitals , field hospital units usually do not have a large number of 68WM6 \( LPN \) , and instead use the combat medic who is readily available and partially trained Some medics opt for EMT I or EMT P certification or additional certifications through civilian education Medics completing the equivalent of an associate 's degree with required science prerequisites may apply for the Inter service Physician Assistant Program \( IPAP \) The intensive two year program results in a civilian master 's degree , an officer 's commission , and the opportunity to sit for civilian certification Healthcare specialist also serve as the primary source for recruiting special operations
