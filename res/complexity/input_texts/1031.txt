intellectual stance during the 1920s 1940s Fuller envisaged that the seminary would become a Caltech of the evangelical world The earliest faculty held theologically and socially conservative views , though professors with differing perspectives arrived in the 1960s and 1970s There were tensions in the late 1950s and early 1960s as some faculty members became uncomfortable with staff and students who did not agree with Biblical inerrancy This led to the people associated with the seminary playing a role in the rise of neo evangelicalism Presidents Fuller has had five presidents over its 70 year history Founding President Ockenga remained in Boston and served as president in absentia from 1947 to 1954 He described his role to Charles Fuller as recruiting faculty and setting the curriculum , which did not require his active presence in Pasadena His successor and protege Edward John Carnell , a Baptist theologian and apologist , took over the post in 1954 but resigned in 1959 under failing health Ockenga resumed his in absentia leadership until 35 year old David Allen Hubbard , a Baptist Old Testament scholar and member of Fuller 's third entering class , came on as Fuller 's third president in 1963 Hubbard served for 30 years and led the seminary through both substantial growth and significant controversy Hubbard was succeeded by Presbyterian philosopher and theologian
