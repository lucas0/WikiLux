wins or loses , having played for the Rangers at the start of the season before being signed by the Cardinals on August 11 after his release from Texas three days earlier The setup was similar to what Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina 's brother Bengie experienced in the season Rhodes will be the seventh player in baseball history to be a member of both rosters playing in the World Series in one season , and the third to have played for both World Series bound teams during the regular season , after the elder Molina and Lonnie Smith This is the first World Series assignment for umpires Greg

rotation would stay in the rotation for the entire year C J Wilson tied for the league lead in starts with 34 while Derek Holland for second in shutouts with four , tied for first in the American League , and each pitcher would have at least 13 wins The offense , always considered a strong point for the team , would also have another good year with three players getting 30 home runs for the

Kinsler led off with a bloop single , and stole second with Andrus batting Andrus singled into center field , and moved to second on the throw home , which got by Albert Pujols for an error With runners on second and third , and none out , Tony La Russa switched in Arthur Rhodes for Motte Consecutive sacrifice flies from Josh Hamilton and Michael Young gave Texas the lead Neftal Feliz came on in the ninth , and allowed a leadoff walk to Yadier Molina , but retired the next three batters in order to end the game and tie the Series at one game apiece Game 3 Saturday , October 22 , 2011 8 05 p m \( EDT \) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington in Texas After a total of just eight runs scored in the first two games in St Louis , the offense of the two lineups scored a combined 23 runs on a
