detective 's presentation on the history of Satanism given in 1989 , and describes him as easily the least reputable source of reliable information on religious groups Many Catholic and Protestant organizations consider Chick to be intensely anti Catholic , based on his various claims about the Roman Catholic Church Chick responds to these accusations by saying he is opposed to the Roman Catholic Church as a sociopolitical organization but not to its individual members On his Roman Catholicism FAQ , Chick says he began publishing his theories about the Roman Catholic Church because he loves Catholics and wants them to be saved through faith in Jesus Catholic Answers calls Chick savagely anti Catholic , describes Chick 's claims about the Catholic Church as bizarre and often grotesque in their arguments , and calls for the tracts to be pulled from the market and corrected In the early 1980s , Chick 's stance on Catholicism led some Christian bookstores to stop stocking his tracts , and he withdrew from the Christian Booksellers Association after the association considered expelling him Christianity Today described Jack Chick as an example of the world of ordinary , nonlearned evangelicals , for whom atavistic anti Catholicism remains as colorful and unmistakable as ever Michael Ian Borer , a sociology professor of Furman University at the time , showed Chick 's
