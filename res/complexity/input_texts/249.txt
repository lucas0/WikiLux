located at Kolleti Kota on one of the eastern islands of the lake The enemy general muhammadan probably a Bahamany general encamped at Chiguru kota located on the shores In some ways , the lake protected the Odia forces The enemy finally tried to excavate a channel , the modern day Upputeru , so that the water of the lake would empty into the sea and the level would fall so that they could attack the Gajapathi fort The royal Odia army general sacrificed his own daughter to propitiate Gods and ensure his success against Muhammadan and her name was Perantala Kanama Therefore , the channel
