president from June 30 , 2006 to November 2006 after Cecilia Fire Thunder was impeached From 2000 to 2002 , he earned unwanted publicity when United States federal drug agents raided his farm and destroyed his crop of industrial hemp before he could harvest it for seed as intended They got a court order prohibiting him to grow the crop Although the Oglala Sioux have sovereignty on their land and hemp does not have psychoactive properties , the agents operated under a 1968 federal anti drug law prohibiting the cultivation of Cannabis related crops By contrast , the sale of hemp products is allowed in the United States Issues of tribal sovereignty on this issue are still at play , although the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the DEA action They acknowledged that the DEA

and his family planted industrial hemp on their farm on the Pine Ridge Reservation He is reportedly the only farmer to date to openly plant , cultivate , and produce cannabis related crops within the borders of the United States since they were prohibited by federal anti drug laws in 1968 While hemp products can be sold in the United States , its cultivation is prohibited , a law implemented by the Drug Enforcement Administration \( DEA \) Although related to cannabis , hemp does not have psychoactive properties and is in demand worldwide for a variety of uses , including processing as a
