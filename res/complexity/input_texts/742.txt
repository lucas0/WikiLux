Official Canada China relations date to 1942 , when Canada sent its own ambassador to China Before then , Canada had been represented in China by the British ambassador The Communist victory in the

Embassy of Canada in China thumb Embassy of China in Canada Background Canadian relations with China were originally mediated through the British ambassador , who represented the interests of the entire British Empire in China A growing Canadian national identity and Canadian participation in World War II made it desirable to establish separate diplomatic representation for Canada in China In 1942 , Canada posted its first ambassador in the Chinese wartime capital of Chongqing The embassy was then moved to the permanent capital of Nanjing in 1946 Canada China relations faced a quandary after the Communists won the Chinese Civil War The United Kingdom followed its longstanding policy of extending diplomatic recognition to a newly established government , while the United States refused to recognize the Communist government Canada had close ties to both Britain and the United States , and the Canadian government was split on the issue After the Liberal victory in the Canadian federal election of 1949 and more discussion within the Canadian government , Canada chose the British approach The Canadian embassy in Nanjing was kept open , and Canada posted a charg d'affaires to maintain relations with China By June 23 , 1950 , the Canadian Department of External Affairs had prepared instructions for the charg to open negotiations with the Chinese government for an exchange of ambassadors However , the Korean War began two days later , on June 25 , 1950 With Canadian troops fighting on the opposing side from Chinese troops , the continuation of diplomatic relations became untenable After Canada voted in favor of a UN Resolution that branded China an aggressor , the Chinese government asked the Canadian charg to leave The Canadian embassy in Nanjing was closed on February 26 , 1951 Thereafter , Canada maintained diplomatic relations with the Republic of China , whose government had evacuated to Taiwan after losing to the Communists However , Canada did not send an ambassador to the Nationalist Chinese capital of Taipei Instead , relations were maintained through the Nationalist Chinese ambassador in Ottawa Diplomatic opening and early trade In 1961 ,
