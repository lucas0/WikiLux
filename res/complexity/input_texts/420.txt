Within Our Gates is a 1920 silent race film that dramatically depicts the racial situation in America during the violent years of Jim Crow , the Ku Klux Klan , the Great Migration , and the emergence of the New Negro The story focuses on an African American woman who goes North in an effort to help a minister in the Deep South raise money to keep a school open for poor Black children Her romance with a black doctor eventually leads to revelations about her family 's past that expose the racial skeletons in America 's closet , most famously through the film 's depiction of the injustice of lynching Produced , written and directed by novelist Oscar Micheaux , it is the oldest known surviving film made by an African American director Lost for decades , a single print of the film , entitled La Negra , was discovered in Spain in the 1970s Holloway , David and Beck , John American Visual Cultures 2005 , page 60Mellencamp , Patricia A Fine Romance Five Ages of Film Feminism 1995 ,

years earlier , Micheaux 's project has been characterized as a response to the racism inherent to Griffith 's work The film 's depiction of the horror of lynching suggests what Blacks knew and Northern Whites refused to believe , turning the accusation of 'primitivism' back onto White Southern culture Mellencamp , Patricia A Fine Romance Five Ages of Film Feminism 1995 , page 230 1

possible The Spanish titles were retranslated into English by Gene DeAnna He removed explanatory material which had been added and reproduced the style which Micheaux used in his books The missing sequence was summarized with an intertitle frame Plot The film opens with Sylvia Landry \( Evelyn Preer \) , a young African American woman , visiting her cousin Alma in the North , while she waits

rejected by the Board of Censors in Chicago when Micheaux first submitted the film in December 1919 An article in the Chicago Defender of 17 January 1920 claimed This is the picture that it required two solid months to get by the Censor Boards A week later the Defender reported Those who reasoned with the spectacle of last July in Chicago ever before them , declared the showing pre eminently dangerous while those who reasoned with the knowledge of existing conditions , the injustices of the times , the lynchings and handicaps of ignorance , determined that the time is ripe to bring the lesson to the front Critics of the film feared that the vivid lynch and attempted rape scenes would spark further interracial violence in a city still tense from the riots of July Officials in Omaha , New Orleans , and other cities stated these objections when they refused permission to screen the film , or demanded that these sensational scenes be cut Despite , or perhaps in part because , of the controversy , the film garnered large audiences in Chicago when it was released in January 1920 Apparently the film often screened in different cut versions For example , an article in the Defender reported that on Tuesday , February 24th of 1920 , Within Our Gates will be shown at the States Theater in Chicago without the cuts which were made before its initial presentation Other evidence of cuts included extant film stills of scenes that did not appear in the surviving film copy , as well as viewers' descriptions that are different from the film as we know it The film is considered an important document of African American life in the years immediately following World War I , when racism was still rampant throughout the United States In 1992 , Within Our Gates was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant Aesthetics left thumb A still from the film , showing the stars Early judgments that Micheaux 's work lacked aesthetic finesse or artistic power now appear short sighted Micheaux carefully constructed Within Our Gates to educate his audience about racism , uplift , peonage , women 's rights , and the urban new Negro emerging after the Great Migration His movement back and forth from North to South repeated that of D W Griffith , who used a North South marriage plot Griffith dramatized a white reunion of regions that canceled the legacy of Reconstruction to leave blacks out of the national picture Micheaux 's film ended with a wedding as well , but his occurred between two sophisticated African Americans His protagonists from the South and the North lay claim to the whole Nation They did this in the face of discriminatory treatment of blacks in the military during World War I , and eruptions of violence that met some returning African American veterans left thumb Images of the New Negro The educated Sylvia dreams of her union with Dr VivianCritics \( such as Jane Gaines , Ronald Green , and Pearl Bowser and Louise Spence \) celebrated the skill with which Micheaux intercut the lynching of the Landry family with the attempted rape of Sylvia by Gridlestone This editing deconstructed the ideology that whites had used in justifying lynching as punishment of black men for alleged sexual assaults against white women The real story , as Micheaux demonstrated , was quite the opposite His work reminded the audience of the long standing practice of sexual predation by white men against black women , which has its roots in slavery days Many other episodes turned out to be cleverly edited in ways that both showed and deconstructed white visual traditions and white ideologies right thumb Micheaux used intertitles to reference contemporary political events Notable , too , was the detailed layering of allusions to current social and political events , from the death of Theodore Roosevelt to the heroism of African American soldiers in the war to debates in the Senate over Jim Crow and peonage The film 's weaknesses may be excused by Michaeux 's extremely limited budget and punishing schedule , and by the fragmentary nature of the only surviving print In fact , we will probably never know what the original film looked like , or whether the only extant version is what Micheaux originally intended Representation of racism The film attempted to portray the many different faces of contemporary African American society There were heroes and heroines , like Sylvia and Reverend Jacobs , but there were also criminals like Larry and lackeys like a minister whom Mrs Stafford supported , who tried to encourage African Americans to reject suffrage Some critics have suggested that Bernice Ladd , who plays Mrs Stafford , represents a Lillian Gish figure , referring to the actress' role in The Birth of a Nation , for the anti feminist and racist characteristics she embodies Green , Ronald J Straight Lick 2000 , page 9 10 Ladd also bears a physical resemblance to Gish , suggesting a deliberate continuity by Micheaux Green , Ronald J With a Crooked Stick 2004 , page 47Robinson , Cedric J Forgeries of Memory and Meaning 2007 , p 252 3 Mr Gridlestone 's servant Efram attempted to ingratiate himself with the local white population by denouncing Mr Landry as the murderer , even though he did not actually see the crime committed Though he celebrated his relationship with the white community , Efram was lynched when the mob failed to find the Landrys Micheaux recognized the complexity of African American life , particularly in the Deep South He was reluctant to blame only whites for the poverty of Blacks He criticized Blacks who helped to perpetuate their condition for personal
