Academy and in the non commissioned officer School From December 4 , 1990 until August 24 , 1991 he was appointed as the Chief of the Intelligence Branch of Mount Lebanon On August 25 , 1991 he was reassigned to the post of the Army Staff Secretary General until June 10 , 1993 He was Commander of the 11th Infantry Brigade from June 6 , 1993 to January 15 , 1996 , a period that witnessed violent confrontations with the Israeli forces in the West Beqaa Valley and South Lebanon regions On January 15 , 1996 he was appointed as Commander of the 6th Infantry Brigade and remained in this position until December 21 , 1998 , when he was appointed as the Commander of the Armed Forces On May 19 , 2007 , the Lebanese Army entered into a prolonged conflict with Fatah al Islam , a terrorist organization based in the Nahr al Bared Refugee Camp in northern Lebanon The conflict lasted until September 2 , 2007 and ended with the Lebanese Army taking complete control of the Camp and the complete defeat of Fatah al Islam 170 Lebanese soldiers , 226 members of Fatah al Islam , and 64 civilians \( mostly Palestinian refugees \) were killed in the fighting Due to a number of reasons , including balancing the interests of Lebanese citizens , concerns for the safety of Palestinian refugees , and respecting the delicate political balance that existed in Lebanon at the time , Suleiman was forced to proceed in the conflict with extreme caution and managed to do so successfully , backed by popular and political support for the LAF On May 7 , 2008 , an ongoing political crisis between government loyalists and the opposition quickly spiraled out of control when Hezbollah announced that the government 's decisions to declare the group 's private telecommunications network as illegal and to relieve the head of security at Beirut International Airport \( an alleged Hezbollah sympathizer \) of his duties amounted to a declaration of war Fighting immediately broke out throughout the country , with members of Hezbollah and its allies in the Amal Movement and the Syrian Social Nationalist Party quickly bearing down on their enemies in the Future Movement and the Progressive Socialist Party The fighting lasted until May 14 , 2008 , when the Lebanese government canceled its two decisions after the proposition of Suleiman to do so As the crisis ended , Suleiman was the subject of criticism by some commentators and politicians since the Army did not directly intervene in the armed clashes that took place but instead tried to separate between fighters and protected political figures On the other hand , others defended his stance by arguing that the only way to preserve the Army 's unity and prevent another civil war was to ensure that it remained uninvolved in the fighting against the Lebanese citizens Path to the Presidency On November 23 , 2007 , the term of Emile Lahoud , the 11th President of Lebanon , came to an end At the time , the Lebanese political spectrum was deeply polarized , with virtually all parties being divided either in the government loyalists \( known as the March 14 camp \) , or the opposition \( known as the March 8 camp \) The two camps could not come to an agreement as to who should become the country 's 12th president , and so , as a result of a provision in the country 's Constitution , the powers of the Presidency transferred to the Government in the expectation that an agreement would be reached shortly afterwards Several names were advanced as potential candidates for the presidency , including Michel Aoun , Nassib Lahoud , Boutros Harb , amongst others , each of whom was affiliated either to the March 14 or March 8 camps It soon became apparent however that only an independent candidate would be acceptable to both sides Michel Suleiman was generally accepted as being the only possible candidate and as a unifying candidate Most Lebanese commentators and policy makers agreed that Suleiman had successfully won the trust of both the government and opposition camp , and that of most countries in the Arab region , as well as most Western countries However , his election could not take place until a number of fundamental disagreements between the March 14 and March 8 camps could be resolved , including the issue of whether a government of national unity should be formed , and what specific electoral law should be passed in preparation for the parliamentary elections that were to take place in 2009 These difficulties were eventually resolved during the negotiations that took place in Doha , Qatar from May 17 to May 20 , 2008 The negotiations were attended by senior representatives from all of Lebanon 's major political parties , and the agreement confirmed that Michel Suleiman would be the preferred candidate in the presidential election When the vote was finally held in Parliament on May 25 , 2008 , Suleiman was elected with a majority of 118 votes out of 127 He was indirectly elected by the Lebanese Parliament , which had n't had a session , as a result of the ongoing political crisis in the country , for 18 months The Parliament 's session was attended by senior representatives from across Lebanon , the Arab region , the United Nations and the European Union , the United States , European states and many other countries In his acceptance speech which was welcomed by all political figures across the country , the Arab region and the rest of the world , Suleiman spoke of uniting and working towards a solid reconciliation of the country We have paid dearly for our national unity Let us preserve it hand in hand He also made reference to the long standing crisis between the country 's two main political camps when he said that the people have given us their confidence to fulfill their aspirations , not to afflict them with our petty political disputes The Presidency On May 28 , 2008 , President Suleiman reappointed Fouad Siniora as Prime Minister Siniora was the parliamentary majority 's candidate for the position , and Suleiman appointed him in accordance with the country 's Constitution and with a majority of 68 MPs who named him Shortly after assuming the Presidency , Suleiman departed from tradition when he asked that posters bearing his likeness be removed from public display despite the fact that he thanked citizens , institutions , municipalities and cultural organizations for the outpouring of support and affection The Nation 's deputies convened to elect General Michel Suleiman as President of the Republic of Lebanon on May 25 , 2008 , in a public sitting covered by local and international media , with the participation of many heads of State or their representatives , and in a climate of popular
