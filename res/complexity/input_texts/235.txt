Henry Darger \( April 12 \? , 1892 April 13 , 1973 \) was a reclusive American writer and illustrator who worked as a janitor in the Chicago , Illinois area He has become famous for his posthumously discovered 15 , 143 page fantasy manuscript called The Story of the Vivian Girls , in What is known as the Realms of the Unreal , of the Glandeco Angelinnian War Storm , Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion , along with several hundred watercolor paintings and other drawings illustrating the story Darger 's work has become one of the most notable examples of outsider art thumb 400px One of Darger 's paintings Life Darger was born in 1892 While he is believed to have been born on April 12 , the exact date is debated Cook County records show that he was born at home , 350 24th Street In 1913 he witnessed the complete destruction of the town of Countrybrown , Illinois by a huge tornado \( \) When he was four years old , his mother Rose \( n e Fullman \) died of puerperal fever after giving birth to a daughter who was given up for adoption Darger never saw his sister Biographer John MacGregor has discovered that Rose had had two children before Henry , but their whereabouts are unknown By Darger 's own report , his father Henry Sr was kind to him , and they lived together until 1900 In that year the crippled and impoverished Darger , Sr had to be taken to live at St Augustine 's Catholic Mission home , and his son was placed in a Catholic boys' home Darger Sr died in 1905 and his son was institutionalized as feeble minded in Lincoln , Illinois , apparently on the basis of a doctor 's diagnosis that Little Henry 's heart is not in the right place At another time , the diagnosis was masturbation Darger himself felt that much of his problem was being able to see through adult lies and becoming a smart aleck as a result He also went through a lengthy phase of feeling compelled to make strange noises \( akin to Tourette Syndrome \) which irritated others The Lincoln Asylum 's practices included forced labor and severe punishments , which Darger seems to have worked into Vivian Girls He later said that , to be fair , there were also good times there , and he had friends as well as enemies While he was there , he received word that his father had died A series of attempted escapes ended successfully in 1908 The 16 year old returned to Chicago and found menial employment in a Catholic hospital , and in this fashion continued to support himself for the following 50 years Except for his brief stint in the U S Army , his life took on a pattern that seems to have varied little he attended Mass daily , frequently returning for as many as five services he collected and saved a bewildering array of trash from the streets His dress was shabby , although he attempted to keep his clothes clean and mended he was largely a solitary His one close friend , William Shloder , was of like mind with Darger on the subject of protecting abused and neglected children , and the pair proposed founding a Children 's Protective Society which would put such children up for adoption to loving families Shloder left Chicago sometime in the mid 1930s In 1930 , Darger settled into a second floor room on Chicago 's north side It was in this room , more than 40 years later , after his death in 1973 , that Darger 's extraordinary secret life was discovered Darger 's landlords , Nathan and Kiyoko Lerner , came across his work shortly before his death on April 13 1973 , evidently the day after his 81st birthday \( at the same Catholic Mission St Augustine 's where his father had died , operated by the Little Sisters of the Poor \) and recognized its merit They took charge of the Darger estate , publicizing his work and contributing to projects such as the 2004 documentary In the Realms of the Unreal He has become well known posthumously in certain artistic circles for his works due to the efforts of people he knew at saving those works Darger has become a name in the world of outsider art At the New York Outsider Art Fair , held every January , and at auction , his work is among the highest priced of any outsider artist The American Folk Art Museum opened a Henry Darger Study Center in 2002 , and Intuit in Chicago is currently trying to recreate his apartment for display The Story of the Vivian Girls His work contains many religious themes , albeit handled extremely idiosyncratically The Story of the Vivian Girls postulates a large planet around which Earth orbits as a moon and where most people are Christian \( mostly Catholic \) The majority of the story concerns the adventures of the daughters of Robert Vivian , seven sisters who are princesses of the Christian nation of Abbiennia , who assist a daring rebellion against the evil John Manley 's regime of child slavery imposed by the Glandelinians The latter resemble Confederate soldiers from the American Civil War \( Darger , like his father , was a Civil War expert \) Children take up arms in their own defense and are often slain in battle , or after vicious torture by the Glandelinian overlords The elaborate mythology also includes a species called the Blengigomeneans \( or Blengins for short \) , winged beings with curved horns , who occasionally take human or part human form They are usually \( not always \) benevolent toward the Vivian Girls The fictive war was sparked by Darger 's loss of a newspaper photograph of Elsie Paroubek , a five year old Chicago girl strangled in 1911 whose murderer was never found According to his autobiography Darger believed the photo was in amongst several items that were stolen when his apartment was broken into He never found his copy of the photograph again He did locate the picture in a public library newspaper archive , but could n't have it photocopied and attempts to trace it proved futile As a result , Paroubek , under the name of Anna Aronburg , became a character in the story In Vivian Girls , the assassination of the child labor rebel Anna Aronburg was the most shocking child murder ever caused by the Glandelinian Government , and was the cause of the war Through their sufferings , the Vivian Girls are to be able to bring about a triumph of Christianity Darger provided two endings to the story in one , the Vivian Girls and Christianity are triumphant in the other , they are defeated and the godless Glandelinians reign Darger 's human figures were rendered largely by tracing , collage , or photo enlargement from popular magazines and children 's books \( Much of the trash he collected was old magazines and newspapers which he clipped for source material \) Some of his favorite figures were the Coppertone Girl and Little Annie Rooney He is praised for his natural gift for composition and the brilliant use of color in his watercolors The images of daring escapes , mighty battles and painful torture are reminiscent of events in Catholic history the text makes it clear that the child victims are heroic martyrs like the early saints One idiosyncratic feature of his artwork is an apparent transgenderism characters are often portrayed unclothed or partially clothed , and regardless of ostensible gender , some females have male sex organs Some feel Darger was unfamiliar with female anatomy , that he meant it as a symbol of power \( a chapter of Vivian Girls includes an articulate rant on the ability of girls to accomplish as much as boys \) or that he modeled the girls after images of the infant Jesus Darger 's mental state Much modern fascination with Darger concerns his portrayal of horrific brutality against children It is sometimes assumed that Darger wrote and drew this way because he was enacting repressed subconscious desires biographer MacGregor claims that Darger may have killed Paroubek , and perhaps other children , and that even if he committed no crime , he had the mind of a serial killer Last years In 1968 , Darger became interested in tracing some of his frustrations back to his childhood It was in this year that he wrote The History of My Life , a book that spends 206 pages detailing his early life before veering off into 4 , 672 pages of fiction about a huge twister called Sweetie Pie , probably based on his experience at Countrybrown He also kept a diary to chronicle the weather and his daily activities Darger often concerned himself with the plight of abused and neglected children the institution where he had lived was brought under investigation in a huge scandal shortly after he left , and he might have seen victims of child abuse in the hospital where he worked The sequel to Vivian Girls is called Crazy House Further Adventures in Chicago Begun in 1939 , it is a Stephen King like tale of a house which is possessed by demons , haunted by ghosts , or perhaps has an evil consciousness of its own , like the hotel in The Shining Children disappear into the house and are later found brutally murdered The Vivians and a male friend are sent to investigate and discover that the murders are the work of evil ghosts The girls go about exorcising each room until the house is clean thumb

and especially since the 1990s there have been many references in popular culture to Darger 's work These have variously incorporated elements of his artistic style , his themes , and the events of his life many refer to The Vivian Girls , the young heroines of his massive illustrated novel These have included references by other visual artists \( including , but not limited to , artists of comics and graphic novels \) , numerous songs \( one of the earliest being by Snakefinger in 1979 \) , a book length poem by John Ashberry , and a 2004 multimedia piece by choreographer Pat Graney incorporating Darger images Trivia Darger 's posthumous biographer , the psychoanalyst John M MacGregor has speculated that Darger may have been the culprit of the 1911 strangling of Elsie Paroubek \(
