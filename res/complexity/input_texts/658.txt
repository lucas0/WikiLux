any lawyer or law student who reads the Bare Act of the Constitution of India This is because it is not included in the text of the main document of provisions set out in Constitution of India https klbhatia wordpress com 2014 04 17 article 35a a mishmash of the textual constitution of india Article 35A was not added to the Constitution by following the procedure prescribed for amendment of the Constitution of India under Article 368 Therefore , it is , allegedly , ultra vires the Constitution since it violates the Constitutional procedures established by law https klbhatia wordpress com 2014 04 17 article 35a a mishmash of the textual constitution of india The legality issues pointed are It has been brought about by the executive organ when actually the right of amendment of the Constitution lies with the legislative organ Therefore , this Article violates the principle of Separation of Power which is a basic feature based on which the Indian Democracy is run http www kashmirobserver net news opinion article 35a unconstitutional amendment It violates the Indian democratic principle in the following way The members of the legislature are elected representatives of the people When any Article is added to the Constitution it is done so by 2 3rd majority of both houses of the Union Parliament present and voting in favor of such addition These representatives are thereby expressing the representative will of the people of the country This democratic procedure was violated in this case and the will of the people was not ascertained When the bare text of the Constitution is read , wherever there is an addition of any Article or repeal or amendment to the provisions , a footnote is inserted to inform the reader by which Constitutional Amendment the change or modification was made In this case , there was no Constitutional Amendment made as is the usual practice Therefore , the power holders found it inconvenient to insert the Article 35 A into the bare text The footnote would have to read Presidential Order and the reader would immediately question the validity of the procedure followed for its addition So as to prevent many uncomfortable questions being asked , the best option was to prevent the addition of the Article into the Bare text , thereby concealing its illegality This also meant that the amending power of Parliament under Article 368 of the Constitution itself was abridged in its application to J K , another amendment , without any reference to Parliament When the President of India does not have legislative powers , he performed the function of Parliament The main objections raised are It facilitates the violation of the basic right of women to marry a man of their choice by not giving the heirs any right to property if the woman marries a man not holding PRC Therefore , her children are not given Permanent Resident Certificate and thereby considering them illegitimate not given any right to such a woman s property even if she is a permanent Resident It facilitates the free and unrestrained violation of fundamental rights of those workers and settlers like Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe people who have lived there for generations The Valmikis who were brought to the state during 1957 were given Permanent Resident Certificates on the condition that they and their future generations could stay in the state only if they continued to be safai karmacharis \( scavengers \) And even after six decades of service in the state , their children are safai karmacharis and they have been denied the right to quit scavenging and choose any other profession http www dailyo in politics article 370 jammu kashmir article 35 modi government pdp story 1 4920 html The industrial sector whole private sector suffers due
