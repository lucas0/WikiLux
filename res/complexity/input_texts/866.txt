Days and Chuck Taylor thumb right 175px Chuck Taylor In his late 30 's , Marquis M Converse , who was previously a respected manager at a footwear manufacturing firm , opened the Converse Rubber Shoe Company \( also known as the Boston Rubber Shoe Company \) in Malden , Massachusetts in 1908 The company was a rubber shoe manufacturer , providing winterized rubber soled footwear for men , women , and children By 1910 , Converse was producing 4 , 000 shoes daily , but it was n't until 1915 that the company began manufacturing athletic shoes for tennis The company 's main turning point came in 1917 when the Converse All Star basketball shoe was introduced This was a real innovation at the time , considering the sport was only 25 years old Then in 1921 , a basketball player named Charles H Chuck Taylor walked into Converse complaining of sore feet Converse gave him a job He worked as a salesman and ambassador , promoting the shoes around the United States , and in 1923 after publishing a retrospective on the first 60 years of basketball and teaching his first basketball clinic at North Carolina State University , his signature was added to the All Star patch He tirelessly continued this work until shortly before his death in 1969 Converse also customized shoes for the New York Renaissance \( the Rens \) , basketball 's first all African American pro basketball team 1941 Present War , Bankruptcy , and New Management When America entered World War II in 1941 , Converse shifted production to manufacturing footwear , apparel , boots , parkas , rubber protective suits , and ponchos for pilots and troops Widely popular during the 1950s and 1960s , Converse lost much of its apparent near monopoly from the 1970s onward , with the surge of new competitors such as Nike , Adidas and Reebok who introduced radical new designs to the market Converse found themselves no longer the official shoe of the National Basketball Association , a title they had enjoyed for many , many years This loss of market share , combined with poor business decisions forced Converse to file for bankruptcy on January 22 , 2001 When the company subsequently changed hands that year , the last factory in the United States was closed Thereafter , manufacturing for the American market was no longer performed in the United States , but instead in a number of Asian countries , including China , Indonesia and Vietnam On July 9 , 2003 , the company accepted a 305 million purchase offer from rival Nike Style thumb 175px Converse fashion in Paris From Rubber to an All Star The Converse

colors Different materials started to appear also , such as leather , suede and vinyl , and even hemp , rather than just canvas A low top or Oxford and high top versions , and later knee high versions were produced After Converse was bought by Nike and operations were moved from the United States to overseas , the design has had a few alterations The fabric is no longer 2 ply cotton canvas but 1
