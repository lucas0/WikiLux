International Encyclopedia of Political Science , Volume 1 SAGE , 2011 ISBN 9781412959636 p 1350 The focus of this debate was Mustafa Kemal 's abolition of the caliphate in 1924 , and the response of some Arab Muslim scholars that it was incumbent upon Arabs in particular to re institute the caliphate in Arab lands Abdul Raziq wrote that past rulers spread the notion of religious justification for the caliphate so that they could use religion as a shield protecting their thrones against the attacks of rebels Kemal H Karpat The Politicization of Islam Reconstructing Identity , State , Faith ,

9780814782613 Secularism and Islam and the Foundations of Governance He was erroneously regarded as the intellectual father of Islamic laicism or secularism \( the separation of state and religion , not the secularization of society \) Due to its controversial standpoints regarding the necessity of the caliphate and religious government , the book triggered an intellectual and political battle in Egypt In essence the author claims that the Muslims may agree on any kind of government , be it religious or worldly , as long as it serves the interest and common welfare of their society Abdel Raziq 's arguments 1 The two main sources of Islamic law \( sharia \) , the Quran and the Sunnah \( Tradition of Messenger Muhammad \) , neither demand nor reject the rule of a caliph \( caliphate \) or imam \( imamate \) 2 There is no real ijma \( consensus \) on the necessity of the caliphate 3 Experience shows that the caliphate entailed a series of disasters for the Muslim community , and there is no single rational argument for the \( re \) establishment of the caliphate As Abdel Raziq recounts the horrors of the caliphate , among other things , one can conclude that he advocated a humanist kind of governance , probably a democratic state The word secular has come to the Arab lexicon since the turn of the twentieth century , bringing with it a host of meanings and interpretations It was first introduced into Arab debates with a connotation for a separation between religion and the state This later evolved to become , la dini and now meant irreligious In present day circles secularism is often understood as almaniya , and has become associated with immorality or the lack of ethics Many contemporary scholars who perhaps have confused various notions and meanings of the idea of secularism have claimed that Abdelraziq was an advocate of secularism in this most negative sense , meaning that he was amoral This is certainly not the case ALi Abdel Raziq argued for the separation of religion from the state , as he clearly states in his essay He could never have advocated irreligiosity or the slackening of moral values He was a man of the highest integrity and he raised his family with great moral uprightness and a deep and true awareness of the importance of the sacred and of belief in God Should one wish to name or classify his practice of Islam , then we could say that his tariqah was that of following the sunnah of the Prophet Muhammed in a simple and moderate manner Perhaps we could even call him a sufi , although he himself would never have been so bold as to name himself one Abdelraziq s book is an enlightened , scientific reading of the Qur an nothing less , nothing more He has used the holy book as his main point of reference As a matter of fact most of the chapters contain an on going chain of versus drawn from the Qur an but related to the main concern of the book , which is governance in Islam Equally , he makes consistent reference to a number of solid \( sahih \) hadiths In fact , Ali Abelraziq , the man and the thinker , steers far away from secularism understood as a form of amoralism , and rather , stays very close to the teachings of the sunnah of Muhammed And this is how he raised us , his family We learned a moderate Islam under his guidance , one that was based on ease , mercy and asceticism or zuhd One allegation is that Ali Abdelraziq did not write Islam and the Foundations of Political Power himself Rather , it was written by someone else , and then given to Abdelraziq to publish in his name What the advocates of this theory have overlooked is the fact that I \( Amr Hamed , grand son of Sheikh A Abdelraziq \) possess the original handwritten manuscript of the book , with a lot of corrections , marginal notes , and footnotes made by Ali Abdelraziq himself Writings Abdel Raziq , Ali Al Islam Wa Usul Al Hukm Bahth Fi l Khilafa Wa l Hukuma Fi l Islam \( Islam and the Foundations of Governance Research on the
