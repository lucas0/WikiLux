Founded in 1946 , The Georgetown Chimes are Georgetown University 's oldest and only all male a cappella singing group History The Georgetown Chimes are an accident of Yale 's and GU 's athletic policies from the time of World War II Yale senior and back up quarterback Francis E \( Frank \) Jones was about to get a start for Yale , when he received notice to report for service with the U S Army Returning home from the Pacific Theater after the end of World War II , now Cpt Frank Jones planned to use his final year 's football eligibility to play quarterback , finally , for Yale While he was in Europe , Frank 's dad petitioned Yale to award his degree , so he could return home and begin law school immediately after the war However , Yale would not permit a grad student to play football Frank still wanted to play , and understood Georgetown would permit it , so Frank headed to Georgetown But , by the time Frank arrived , Georgetown had re visited its football eligibility rules , and Frank 's aim was dashed He enrolled at Georgetown Law School nonetheless and instead of football , he joined Georgetown 's Glee Club Frank sang with his father and four uncles before college , but he was too busy as an athlete at Yale to join one of Yale 's a cappella harmony groups Now post war , remembering the a cappella harmony tradition at Yale , Frank believed that he could create a barbershop singing group that emphasized brotherhood and friendship through harmony The Chimes are forever in Yale 's and Georgetown 's debt for frustrating Frank 's desire to play football for one more year He asked then Glee Club director Edward P Doc Donovan to name the best bass on campus No question about it Chuck Laiosa , came the reply Frank tracked down Chuck Laiosa , and together they began to recruit the best male voices at Georgetown for the Chimes The Chimes quickly developed their own following as an independent performing group , but for its first 15 years the Chimes also was part of the Glee Club The Georgetown Chimes take their name from the original tower bells of Healy Hall In 1946 , Jones , Laiosa and several others were singing for themselves as the tower bell chimes struck in the South Tower of Georgetown University 's Healy Hall Jones named the group on the spot Alma Mater Tower Bells The Georgetown Chimes also is the name of a song the Chimes perform and have recorded , composed by Doc Donovan Later , when those original tower bells fell into disrepair , the Chimes' appearance with the Glee Club on the Ed Sullivan Show led to a donation of carillons to replace the original Georgetown Chimes In the years since their founding , the Georgetown Chimes have grown from the original quartet into a group of 216 Chimes , from 1 , Frank Jones , in 1946 , to 216 Tommy Wiederhold , the Baby Chime From the original barbershop standards , the Chimes' repertoire has grown to include 50s' and 60s' classics , hymns , and show tunes Beginning with the eponymous first record of 1946 , the Chimes have recorded two dozen albums and established a massive repertoire of music With singing in harmony as a foundation for living in friendship , the Chimes have become a family that spans over three generations 18 year old college freshmen call themselves brother Chimes of the octogenerian founders , and of every member in between The Chimes network reaches across space and time to connect men of all generations Wives , children , grandchildren , all attend Chime events , as do their many Georgetown fans In the late 1980s , the Chimes settled into the Chimes House , at 3611 Prospect St one block from the campus of Georgetown University The Chimes House functions as the headquarters for the Chimes , where practices and social gatherings are held Several Chimes live in The House The first five Chimes are honored or remembered by their fellow Chimes with Orchestra seats dedicated in their names , in the Gonda Theatre at the Royden B Davis , S J Performing Arts Center on Georgetown 's campus This is not a coincidence When Father Royden Davis himself was a Georgetown student after returning from WW II and before joining the Jesuit Order , he roomed with Charles P \( Chuck \) Laiosa , the Second Chime He used to complain that he knew when the Chimes were going to perform , because Jones would borrow his dress shirts The Organization Its Service and Ties to Georgetown Once a Chime , always a Chime The Chimes view the group as a tradition , entrusted from one Chime to the next , year over year to now , more than 60 years from its start Numerous Chime alumni return to annual reunions and Chime performances every Chime is fluent in the group 's vast repertoire Active Chimes , usually undergraduates , are the Chimes who make themselves available for practice and performance The Actives also include the current Celestial Chime , James P M Walsh , S J , the Jesuit member of the group Father Walsh has been active as the Celestial Chime for over 25 years He was preceded by Fathers Gerard F Yates , S J and Richard C Law , S J , who as Jesuits were inducted into the group in 1953 The Ephus , a leader among equals , is elected yearly by the active group to serve as their leader for the coming school year The first ephus was Frank Jones , the founder of the group , who despite the legend , never legally changed his name to Francis Edward Ephus Jones The Georgetown Chimes often contribute their talents to university and alumni ceremonies , dedications and functions each year , and even sing the
