, Wall Street Journal , 2007 02 14 Retrieved on 2009 02 25 In October 2006 , the National Community Reinvestment Coalition filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission Federal Trade Commission Complaint stating that Zillow was intentionally misleading consumers and real estate professionals to rely upon the accuracy of its valuation services despite the full knowledge of the company officials that their valuation Automated Valuation Model \( AVM \) mechanism is highly inaccurate and misleading In a letter dated May 4 , 2007 , the FTC elected not to investigate this complaint , which was later withdrawn by the NCRC Real estate brokers state the site does not give an accurate reflection and that other factors must be taken into consideration in buying or selling a home Realtors with specific market knowledge are more likely to know specific factors affecting the sale of a home such as the overall condition of the home , room flow , landscaping , views , traffic noise , and privacy These factors have been called unzillowables , a term coined in the real estate blogosphere Unzillowable , To Coin a Phrase , Sellsius Real Estate Blog The industry fear arises from the possibility that increasing numbers of users will trust internet based valuation companies like Zillow to give good ballpark figures As such , such sites may become a source of competition for real estate agents who , in many jurisdictions , may previously have had exclusive control of this information , Zillow com allows realtors who are listing a house to turn off the Zestimate and charts and data from the Zillow listing Zillow com has an unsatisfactory rating with the Better Business Bureau for Alaska , Oregon , and western Washington BBB Reliability Report for Zillow com References External links Category Online real estate databases Zillow Category Real estate valuation
