Gerald Lawrence Schroeder is an Orthodox Jewish physicist , author , lecturer and teacher at College of Jewish Studies Aish HaTorah 's Discovery Seminar , Essentials and Fellowships programs and Executive Learning Center , who focuses on what he perceives to be an inherent relationship between science and spirituality Education Schroeder received his BSc in 1959 , his MSc in 1961 , and his PhD in nuclear physics and earth and planetary sciences in 1965 , from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \( MIT \) He worked five years on the staff of the MIT physics department He was a member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission Aliyah to Israel After emigrating to Israel in 1971 , Schroeder was employed as a researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science , the Volcani Research Institute , and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem He currently teaches at Aish HaTorah College of Jewish Studies Religious views and scientific theories His works frequently cite Talmudic , Midrashic and medieval commentaries on Biblical creation accounts , such as commentaries written by the Jewish philosopher Nachmanides Among other things , Schroeder attempts to reconcile a six day creation as described in Genesis with the scientific evidence that the world is billions of years old using the idea that the perceived flow of time for a given event in an expanding universe varies with the observer 's perspective of that event He attempts to reconcile the two perspectives numerically , calculating the effect of the stretching of space time , based on Einstein 's general relativity Namely , that from the perspective of the point of origin of the Big Bang , according to Einstein 's equations of the 'stretching factor' , time dilates by a factor of roughly 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , meaning one trillion days on earth would appear to pass as one day from that point , due to the stretching of space When applied to the estimated age of the universe at 13 8 billion years , from the perspective of the point of origin , the universe today would appear to have just begun its sixth day of existence , or if the universe is 15 billion years old from the perspective of earth , it would appear to have just completed its sixth day The Hidden Face of God Science Reveals the Ultimate Truth by Gerald L Schroeder Ph D \( May 9 , 2002 \) Antony Flew , an academic philosopher who promoted atheism for most of his adult life indicated that the arguments of Gerald Schroeder had influenced his decision to become a deist His theories to reconcile faith and science have drawn some criticism from both religious and non religious scientists , and his works remain controversial in scientific circles Gerald Schroeder and his New Variation on the 'Day Age' Theory , 1 August 2000Perakh , Mark Not a Very Big Bang About Genesis , December 2001 Personal Schroeder 's wife Barbara Sofer is a popular columnist for the English language Israeli newspaper Jerusalem Post The couple has five children Prizes In 2012 , Schroeder was awarded the Trotter Prize by Texas A M University 's College of Science Trotter Prize Endowed Lecture Series Works Genesis and the Big Bang \( 1990 \) , The Science of God The Convergence of Scientific and Biblical Wisdom , \( 1997 \) , The Hidden Face of God Science Reveals the Ultimate Truth , \( 2002 \) , God According to God A Physicist Proves We 've Been Wrong About God All Along , \( 2009 \) , References External links Gerald Schroeder \( official website \) MIT Alumni Association News and Views Nuclear Scientist Sees No God Science Conflict Dr Schroeder speaking on cosmology a 30 min clip from the documentary , Has Science Discovered God \?
