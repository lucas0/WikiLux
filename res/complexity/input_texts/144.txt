Leo Armand Paquette \( January 21 , 2019 \) was an American organic chemist Biography He was born on July 15 , 1934 to parents Armand and Clarice with roots in Quebec \( great grandfather Edmund was born in Contrecoeur , Quebechttps www findagrave com memorial 35003439 edmund paquette \) and he received his B S degree from Holy Cross College in 1956 and his Ph D in Organic Chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1959 with Professor Norman Allan Nelson After serving as a Research Associate at the Upjohn Company from 1959 to 1963 , he joined the faculty of The Ohio State University He was promoted to full professor in 1969 and was named Distinguished University Professor in 1987 A member of the National Academy of Sciences since 1984 , Paquette has served on advisory committees for the National Institutes of Health \( NIH \) and the National Science Foundation \( NSF \) , and has been a member of the editorial boards of publications such as the Journal of Organic Chemistry , Journal of the American Chemical Society , Organic Syntheses , Organic Reactions , and as the founding editor of the ''Electronic Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis \( e EROS \) Scientific misconduct In 1993 , an Ohio State University investigation found that Paquette had plagiarized sections from an unfunded NIH grant application , for which he was a reviewer , and included the text in his own NIH grant application The Office of Research Integrity agreed with the University investigation and required institutional certification of proper attribution in any future grant proposals from Paquette and prohibited him from serving on Public Health Service Advisory Committees , Boards , or review groups for ten years For a separate plagiarism incident that occurred in 1991 , the Ohio State University investigatory panel found that Paquette had plagiarized a NSF proposal , that he was also a reviewer for , and included sections in a paper he published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society The NSF 's Office of Inspector General \( OIG \) found that Paquette knowingly submitted falsified evidence for the purpose of disproving the misconduct in science charge and made false statements under oath in the OIG investigation concerning the authenticity of the evidence The falsified evidence consisted of a computer disk that included a 'mock draft , ' a copy of the paper 's final draft that Paquette had marked up to look like an earlier draft and was back dated prior to Paquette 's review of the NSF proposal and , importantly , prior to the manufacture of the disk The US Secret Service also found that someone had attempted to erase the lot number of the disk In 1998 , the NSF entered into a binding settlement with Paquette Paquette would voluntarily exclude himself from any federal funding for two years and the NSF would not issue a finding of misconduct in science Honors Paquette s honors include Sloan Fellow , Guggenheim Fellow , ACS Award for Creative Work in Synthetic Organic Chemistry , and the Arthur C Cope Scholar Award of the ACS Professor Paquette s career has resulted in contributions to numerous areas in the field of organic chemistry , including synthesis and properties of unusual molecules , natural products total synthesis , synthetic methodology , rearrangement processes , and stereoelectronic control Legacy Paquette is perhaps best known for achieving the first total synthesis of the Platonic solid dodecahedrane in 1982 , which still stands as one of the landmark achievements in the history of organic synthesis and hydrocarbon chemistry As of this date , Paquette had authored more than 1000 papers , 38 book chapters , and 17 books , and had guided approximately 150 graduate students to their Ph D degrees Books Encyclopedia of reagents for organic synthesis , 2009 Handbook of reagents for organic synthesis , 1999 2007 Organic Reactions , Editor In Chief , Vols 38 55 Encyclopedia of reagents for organic synthesis , 1995 Comprehensive Organic Synthesis Combining C C pi bonds , 1992 Polyquinane chemistry syntheses and reactions , 1987 Recent synthetic developments in polyquinane chemistry , 1984 Organic chemistry , 1979 Principles of modern heterocyclic chemistry , 1968 Further reading The following are secondary sources in which the contributions of the Paquette research group are reported at significant length See also List of scientific misconduct incidents References External links Category 1934 births Category 2019 deaths Category People from Worcester , Massachusetts Category College of the Holy Cross alumni Category Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category 21st century American chemists Category Ohio State University faculty Category Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category Guggenheim Fellows Category American people of French Canadian descent
