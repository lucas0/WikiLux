is supported by other contributing writers and administrators Kyanka started Something Awful several months before leaving his previous job , after using his Cranky Steve persona to write a comedic website update deriding the attitude and work performance of a fellow Planet Quake administrator He moved the Cranky Steve personality he had created to the Something Awful site in 1999 In the years immediately following Something Awful 's launch , several sponsors , including GameFan and eFront , failed to compensate Kyanka as promised for advertising on the site In 2001 , the site began charging an activation fee \( currently US 9 95 \) for forum access Only members can post messages or threads to encourage new registrations , the forums are only intermittently viewable by unregistered users The site and forums draw continuous income from fees for new accounts , forum upgrades such as custom avatars and access to the forum archives and search features , and merchandise sales Spam Prevention Early Warning System On July 20 , 2003 , the spam filtering organization Spam Prevention Early Warning System \( SPEWS \) added an entire class B subnet with the Cogent ISP to their spammer list , since Cogent was hosting a known spammer that SPEWS found difficult to block Something Awful was added to the list in the process , disrupting its ability to communicate with its customers who were using SPEWS Upon appeal , SPEWS initially refused to delist SA The Something Awful administrators responded by telling their users to post their support in the Usenet newsgroup news admin net abuse blocklisting However , that group and news admin net abuse email were flooded with off topic posts and trolls from Something Awful users , incensing SPEWS advocates The SA administrators claimed that SPEWS was attempting to hack the Something Awful server Forum users responded by threatening to perform a distributed denial of service attack on SPEWS , although this type of behavior was strongly discouraged by Kyanka and assistant editor Zack Parsons Hurricane Katrina charity As the website 's servers were located in New Orleans , the site temporarily went offline in August 2005 during the flooding from Hurricane Katrina After the site was brought to a semi functional state , Kyanka set up a link to a PayPal account where people could donate money to the survivors of the hurricane via the Red Cross Kyanka put in 3 , 000 of his own money , and promised to give some free merchandise to anyone who donated more than 10 PayPal froze the donation account , then stated that they would unfreeze the account once it was provided with proof of shipping from aggrieved buyers Due to the nature of the collection , there were no actual buyers , and it was impossible to provide proof of shipping for donation Eventually , Kyanka contacted a customer service representative over the phone , and asked to have PayPal donate all of the money to the Red Cross However , he was told that PayPal would only give the money to United Way of America due to their business affiliation Kyanka initially agreed , but after receiving several emails from readers detailing alleged corruption and inefficiency within United Way , he changed his mind and told PayPal to refund all of the money to the individual donors PayPal refunded the money , but did not refund exchange and handling fees for international donors Shooting deaths In 2005 , William Freund sought advice in the Something Awful gun subforum about purchasing Hevi Shot brand ammunition several days before embarking on a shooting rampage , during which he killed two people before committing suicide Freund had stated in the thread , which was closed before the killing spree , along with his ability to post comments being revoked , that he intended to use the ammunition to defend his Halloween pumpkins from vandals Uwe Boll fight In June 2006 , Kyanka accepted an open challenge from German movie director Uwe Boll , who had offered to fight critics of his movies in a series of 10 round boxing matches Something Awful had posted a humorous review that was critical of one of his films The event took place in Vancouver , British Columbia on September 23 , 2006 after being knocked down several times and eventually forfeiting the fight in the first round , Kyanka claimed that he had been told by Boll , a trained amateur boxer , that the fight would be just for show To that effect , Kyanka purportedly acted like a silent film comedy character during the fight rather than seriously
