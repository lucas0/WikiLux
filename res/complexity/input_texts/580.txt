The term , Business Architecture , is used to refer to a process , model or profession In these usages , Business Architecture refers to the organizing framework of a business , the documents and diagrams that describe that structure or the people who help build such a structure , respectively A formal definition of the first meaning is defined by the Object Management Group 's Business Architecture Working Group as follows A blueprint of the enterprise that provides a common understanding of the organization and is used to align strategic objectives and tactical demands Object Management Group , Business Architecture Working Group , Definition Overview Business Architecture 's value proposition is to increase operational effectiveness by mapping and modeling the business to the organization 's business vision and strategic goals Mapping identifies gaps between the current and target business capabilities \( underlying processes , people , and tools \) Modeling discovers business requirements in the area of interest including stakeholders , business entities and their relationships , and business integration points Business Architecture is usually one of several architecture domains that form the pillars of an enterprise architecture A business architecture describes the structure and behaviour of a business system \( not necessarily related to computers \) It covers business goals , business functions or capabilities , business processes and roles etc Business functions and business processes are often mapped to the applications and data they need The main elements of the Business Architecture are business domains They can best be looked at as areas of accountability Within the business architecture a high level description is provided of how the business processes are dealt with by these domains and which domain is responsible for specified business functions or objects Thus the main elements of a business architecture are business domains , which are clusters of coherent business functions and objects \( concepts \) , over which meaningful responsibility can be taken in business processes Note that these domains are consciously decoupled from the organizational graph itself and therefore decoupled from current managerial position and interests Assigning the business domains to specific directors and business units is a subsequent activity \( after the creation and acceptance of the business architecture , that is \) A Business Architecture contains 1 \) the lay out of business domains \( including their occurrences on various levels \) and their assigned business activities and added value \( business case \) 2 \) The business functions and business concepts \( high level data descriptions \) that these business domains need \( and are responsible for \) to perform their assigned business activity 3 \) The high level business processes , which shows how these domains work together \( interface \) to achieve the organizational goals and strategies Such a business architecture shows higher level management how their strategy will be implemented in their corporation Approaches that are focusing on the more or less formal organizational structure as such are , compared to Business Architecture , more limited in scope They generally do not describe items like business processes , interfacing between organizational domains and business objects They are therefore of limited use in understanding the consequences of projected strategic change More often organizational diagrams are a derivative of a target Business Architecture , where the pre determined areas of accountability \( business domains \) are subsequently linked to actual departments and managerial key players A higher level definition of Business Architecture is that Business Architecture is a disciplined approach to creating and maintaining a set of business owned information assets that serve as a blueprint for the planning and execution of strategy Business Architecture defines 1 \) How a business is structured 2 \) What it does \( processes \) 3 \) What it needs to perform to achieve its goals This view of Business Architecture focuses on the capabilities \( people , process , infrastructure \) that a business needs to acquire to deliver on its Business Strategy Discussion Business Architecture and Business Strategy Business Architecture is directly based on business strategy It is the foundation for subsequent architectures \( strategy embedding \) , where it is detailed into various aspects and disciplines The business strategy can consist of elements like strategy statements , organizational goals and objectives , generic and or applied business models , etc The strategic statements are analyzed and arranged hierarchically , through techniques like qualitative hierarchical cluster analysis Based on this hierarchy the initial business architecture is further developed , using general organizational structuring methods and business administration theory , like theories on assets and resources and theories on structuring economic activity Based on the business architecture the construction of the organization takes shape \( figure 1 strategy embedding \) During the strategy formulation phase and as a result of the design of the business architecture , the business strategy gets better formulated and understood as well as made more internally consistent The business architecture forms a significantly better basis for subsequent architectures than the separate statements themselves The business architecture gives direction to organizational aspects , such as the organizational structuring \( in which the responsibilities of the business domains are assigned to individuals business units in the organization chart or where a new organization chart is drawn \) and the administrative organization \( describing for instance the financial reconciliation mechanisms between business domains \) Assigning the various business domains to their owners \( managers \) also helps the further development of other architectures , because now the managers of these domains can be involved with a specific assigned responsibility This led to increased involvement of top level management , being domain owners and well aware of their role Detailed portions of business domains can be developed based on the effort and support of the domain owners involved Business architecture therefore is a very helpful pre structuring device for the development , acceptance and implementation of subsequent architectures The perspectives for subsequent design next to organization are more common information architecture , technical architecture , process architecture The various parts \( functions , concepts and processes \) of the business architecture act as a compulsory starting point for the different subsequent architectures It pre structures other architectures Business architecture models shed light on the scantly elaborated relationships between business strategy and business design We will illustrate the value of business architecture in a case study Standards Work The Object Management Group OMG s modeling standards , including the Unified Modeling Language \( UML \) , Model Driven Architecture \( MDA \) and the Business Process Modeling Notation \( BPMN \) , enable powerful visual design , execution and maintenance of software and other processes , including IT Systems Modeling and Business Process Management The OMG established the Business Architecture Working Group \( BAWG \) in December of 2007 to pursue the development of standards to support the Business Architecture community The group has begun an effort to catalog business scenarios and to capture a library of business techniques that will be used to isolate and prioritize areas of work This initiative has as a key part of its mission the interlinking and unification of existing standards to accommodate the demands for integrated end to end business analytics The BAWG conducted a Business Architecture Information Day on September 23 , 2008 in Orlando at the OMG 's quarterly Technical Meeting as part of an outreach effort to bring interested practitioner and vendor organizations into the standards process The Open Group The Open Group 's TOGAF framework is a community based effort for describing methods and tools used by architecture It is being developed and continuously improved by the Open Group , a consortium of interested individuals and companies involved in information technology Although the Open Group limits their framework to be used to develop Information Systems only , their framework includes Business Architecture as one of the four domains of architecture The other three domains are Application Architecture , Data Architecture and Technology Architecture TOGAF describes business architecture as follows the business strategy , governance , organization , and key business processes A Business Architecture describes the structural aspects of the business domain instead of the IT domain TOGAF defines four dimensions , three of which can be considered relevant to Business Architecture Scope \( breadth of the enterprise or across a specific business function from end to end \) , Level of detail , and Time \( as is architecture vs to be architecture \) Frameworks eTOM The eTOM \( tmforum org \) has been applied in a variety of industries , like Telecommunications , Banking , Insurance Industry and Franchise Industry The same basic structure holds , barring the use of industry specific terminology , e g core banking system vs billing system eTOM together with NGOSS , has taken the best of TOGAF and Zachman and applied that into a flexible business architecture environment adaptable to a wide range of industries The core of the eTOM business architecture framework revolves around the SIP \( Strategy , Infrastructure Product \) , Operations \( fulfillment , Assurance and Billing \) , Enterprise Management \( Strategic Enterprise Planning processes , Financial Asset Management processes , Enterprise Risk Management processes , Stakeholder and External Relationships Management processes , Enterprise Effectiveness Management processes , Human Resource Management processes , Knowledge Research Management processes \) The raw business processes are overlayed with the Enterprise Management Processes Balance Score Card or House of Quality , KPI 's and RACI 's are added as control and measurement elements to the processes , from which the instructional processes are developed The ideal is to combine common processes and re map all processes and process flows accordingly Such processes are usable as a basis for SOA implementation , in areas of process automation References Footnotes General References Versteeg , G H Bouwman Business
