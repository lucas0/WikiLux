Marshal of Italy Luigi Cadorna , \( 4 September 1850 21 December 1928 \) was an Italian General and Marshal of Italy , most famous for being the Chief of Staff of the Italian Army during the first part of World War I Early career Luigi Cadorna was born to General Raffaele Cadorna in Verbania Pallanza , Piedmont in 1850 In 1860 Cadorna became a student at the Teuli Military School in Milan At fifteen he entered the Turin Military Academy Upon graduation he was commissioned as a second lieutenant of artillery in 1868 In 1870 , as an officer in the 2nd Regiment of Artillery , Cadorna participated in the occupation of Rome as part of a force commanded by his father As major he was appointed to the staff of General Pianell , afterwards taking the post of Chief of Staff of the Verona Divisional Command As Colonel commanding the 10th Regiment of Bersaglieri from 1892 Cadorna acquired a reputation for strict discipline and harsh punishment He wrote a manual of infantry tactics which laid stress on the doctrine of the offensive Promoted to lieutenant general in 1898 Cadorna subsequently held a number of senior staff and divisional corps command positions On the eve of Italy 's entry into World War \( 1915 \) he was close to peace time retirement age and had a history of differences with his political and military superiors Cadorna had been offered the post of Chief of Staff for the first time in 1908 , which he had rejected over the issue of political control during wartime He was again offered the position in July 1914 , as the Triple Entente and Central Powers girded for war When Italy entered the war in May 1915 on the side of the Entente , Cadorna fielded thirty six infantry divisions composed of 875 , 000 men , but with only 120 modern artillery pieces Marshall

the Second Battle of the Isonzo Cadorna inherited a difficult political and military situation The government of Premier Antonio Salandra favored initial neutrality over Italy 's treaty commitments under the Triple Alliance Cadorna was accordingly obliged to reverse long established strategic plans while discovering that the army was ill prepared for war against Austria Hungary and Germany In particular large numbers of men and quantities of equipment had been deployed to Tripolitania leaving the home army disorganized Cadorna launched four offensives in 1915 , all along the Isonzo River The goal of these offensives was the fortress of Gorizia , the capture of which would permit the Italian armies to pivot south and march on Trieste , or continue on to the Ljubljana Gap All four offensives failed , resulting in some 250 , 000 Italian casualties for little material gain Cadorna would ultimately fight eleven battles on the Isonzo between 1915 and 1917 Additional forces were arrayed along the Trentino salient , attacking towards Rovereto , Trento , and Bolzano These attacks also failed The terrain along the Isonzo and Trentino was completely unsuited for offensive warfare mountainous and broken , with no room for maneuver Marshall , 108 110 On 24 October 1917 a combined Austro Hungarian German army struck across the Isonzo at Kobarid \( called Caporetto in Italian \) and by 12 November had advanced all the way to the Piave River Cadorna 's disposition of most of his troops far forward , with little defense in depth , contributed greatly to the Defeat at Caporetto Keegan , 347 but graver still were the responsibilities of other officers , notably Pietro Badoglio , then corps commander in a sector overrun by the Austro German attack Cadorna himself had been on leave for most of October and his immediate subordinate was seriously ill The Italian Army fled in disarray and seemed on the verge of total collapse 275 , 000 soldiers were captured Italy 's allies Britain and France insisted on the dismissal of Cadorna \( the General was relieved of command on 9 November 1917 \) and sent eleven divisions to reinforce the Italian front However , these troops played no role in stemming the advancing Germans and Austro Hungarians , because they were deployed on the Mincio River , some 97 kilometres \( 60 mi \) behind the Piave , as the British and French strategists did not believe the Piave line could be held The king appointed the respected General Armando Diaz as Chief of General Staff , Marshall , 215 with Badoglio named as his second in command Cadorna was reassigned as the Italian representative to the Allied Supreme War Council set up in Versailles The restored Italian defensive line was held during the subsequent Battle of the Piave River and later served as springboard for the Battle of Vittorio Veneto , where the Austro Hungarian army was finally defeated , after four days of resistance , by 51 Italian divisions , 3 British divisions , 2 French divisions , 1 Czechoslovak Division , 1 U S Infantry Regiment The Italians and their allies captured 426 , 000 enemy soldiers Post war After the war , there was an enquiry held by the Italian government to investigate the defeat at Caporetto It was published in 1919 and was highly critical of Cadorna , at that time a bitter man busy with writing his memoirs who claimed that he had no responsibility for the defeat , despite fleeing to Padua during the battle and abandoning the entire Italian Second Army to its fate Nevertheless , he was made a Field Marshal \( Maresciallo d'Italia \) in 1924 after Benito Mussolini seized power Cadorna died in Bordighera in 1928 Personal reputation Historians record Cadorna as an unimaginative martinet who was ruthless with his troops and dismissive of his country 's political authorities David Stevenson , Professor of International History at the London School of Economics , describes him as earning opprobrium as one of the most callous and incompetent of First World War commanders In manner he appeared a reserved and aristocratic officer of the old fashioned Piedmontese school During the course of the war Cadorna dismissed 217 officers , and during the Battle of Caporetto , he ordered the summary execution of officers whose units retreated Keegan , 227 Six percent of Italian soldiers under his leadership faced a disciplinary charge during the war and 61 percent of them were found guilty About 750 were executed , the highest number in any army in World War I Hew Strachan \( 2003 \) The First World War Claims have been made that he also reintroduced the ancient Roman practice of decimation the killing of every tenth man for units which failed to perform in battle However , the military historian John Keegan records that his judicial savagery took the form of the summary executions of individual stragglers rather than the formalized winnowing of entire detachments In May 1916 , one specific instance of actual decimation occurred in the Italian Army , involving the execution of one in ten soldiers of a 120 strong company of the 141 Catanzaro Infantry Brigade which had mutinied , killing officers , carabinieri and other soldiers Two days later Cadorna endorsed the shooting of the 12 mutineers in a telegram sent to senior officers , but it is not clear whether he had been responsible for initiating this draconian measure Family He was the father of Raffaele Cadorna , Jr , an Italian general who fought during World War I and World War II , who was famous as one of the commanders of the Italian Resistance against German occupying forces in north Italy after 1943 Notes References Other Sources External links Luigi Cadorna on First World War com Anna Grillini Carorna , Luigi , in
