The specialist schools programme is a UK government initiative which encourages secondary schools in England to specialise in certain areas of the curriculum to boost achievement The Specialist Schools and Academies Trust is responsible for the delivery of the programme Currently there are nearly 3 , 000 specialist schools , or 88 of the state funded secondary schools in England The government plans that eventually all schools in England will specialise Scotland , Wales , and Northern Ireland control their own education systems there are no specialist schools in Scotland or Wales In Northern Ireland specialist school status has been granted to 34 schools by the Department of Education as of June 2008 , part of a three year pilot History thumb right 340px Numbers of specialist schools in England by year and first specialism The Education Reform Act 1988 introduced a new compulsory subject of Technology , but there were insufficient funds to equip all schools to teach the subject A first attempt at developing centres of excellence , the City Technology College programme between 1988 and 1993 , had produced only 15 schools In 1994 , the Conservative government , at the urging of Sir Cyril Taylor , designated 35 grant maintained and voluntary aided schools as Technology Colleges The schools were required to arrange private sponsorship of 100 , 000 , and would then receive a matching government capital grant and increased recurrent funding The following year the programme was opened to all maintained schools , and specialism in Languages was added Specialisms in Arts and Sport were added in 1996 As specialism implied diversity of schools , it was opposed by many supporters of comprehensive schools , including many in the Labour Party Nevertheless , in 1997 the new Labour government , also encouraged by Sir Cyril Taylor , adopted the embryonic programme , and the number of specialist schools continued to grow The School Standards and Framework Act 1998 made it possible for specialist schools to select up to 10 of their intake on aptitude in the existing specialisms in sport , the arts , modern languages and technology , though new selection for aptitude in technology was prohibited in 2008 However few have taken up this option The 2001 white paper Schools Achieving Success envisaged expansion of the programme to 50 of secondary schools by 2005 , and introduced new specialisms in Business and Enterprise , Engineering , Mathematics and Computing and Science The emphasis was shifting from centres of excellence to a means of driving up standards in most schools The required amount of private sponsorship was halved , and could be made up of goods and services in lieu of cash Software donations had been ineligible due to the difficulty in evaluating the true value of something that has no manufacturing cost and can simply be given away as a form of collateral , but this changed when Oracle and then Microsoft were allowed to sponsor the programme with in kind donations In 2002 the government introduced the Partnership Fund , funded at 3million per annum , to make up the shortfall for schools that were unable to raise the required 50 , 000 of private sponsorship Specialisms in Humanities and Music were added in 2004 By 2008 approximately 90 of maintained secondary schools had become specialist schools Extension of the specialist programme to primary schools is being trialled at 34 schools , starting in 2007 The specialisms involved in the pilot are Arts , Music , Languages , Science and Physical Education Sport Gaining specialist school status To apply for specialist school status , a school must demonstrate reasonable standards of achievement , and produce a four year development plan with quantified targets related to learning outcomes The school must also raise 50 , 000 in private sector sponsorship Private sector sponsorship includes charitable trusts , internal fund raising and donations from private companies In some cases donations can be made in cash from entities in the private sector such as Arcadia and HSBC , but may also be donations in kind of goods or services The total sponsorship to date is of the order of 100m A school may specialise in any of the following fields , or combine specialisms in two of them \( at the same level of funding \) Arts \( can be Media , Performing Arts , Visual Arts , or combination of these \) Business Enterprise Engineering Humanities Languages Mathematics Computing Music Science Sports Technology Specialist schools must still meet the full requirements of the English national curriculum , so the specialism is seen as adding value to the existing statutory provision rather than being a radical departure from it The important aspect in the eyes of the government is the focus that the specialism provides for providing leadership in the quest for whole school improvement The reward for achieving specialist status is a government grant of 100 , 000 to go with the 50 , 000 in sponsorship for a capital project related to the specialism and an extra 129 per pupil per year for four years to support the development plan This is normally targeted on additional staffing and professional development , though up to 30 may be spent on equipment Schools that make a good attempt at achieving their targets over the 4 year development plan period normally have their grants renewed at 3 year intervals with no further need to raise sponsorship However since 2008 , the government has sought to encourage long term relationships with business partners by offering a matching grant to redesignating specialist schools that are able to raise a further 25 , 000 in private sponsorship Schools that do particularly well may apply to be designated as High Performing Specialist Schools , with an additional specialism and further funds to forge partnerships with other secondary schools By 2008 some 600 schools \( 20 of specialist schools \) had achieved this status Evaluation Results David Jesson of the University of York has published a series of annual studies of the results of the specialist schools program , on behalf of the SSAT These studies report that non selective specialist schools scored achieve significantly higher results at GCSE results than non specialist comprehensive schools , that they achieve higher added value when prior achievement is taken into account , and that the gains increase with the length of time the school has been specialist Jesson 's statistical methodology has been criticised , and others have pointed out that early specialist schools were chosen for the programme because they were already successful Other studies have found that specialist schools perform slightly better at GCSE , particularly benefitting more able pupils and narrowing the gap between boys and girls The most recent studies attribute this increase to the additional funding , and report that the effect is diminishing as a greater proportion of schools become specialist Criticisms The specialist schools programme has been widely criticised The two biggest UK teaching unions have opposed the programme because they say that it creates a two tier education system , made up of specialist schools with extra funding and non specialist schools which cannot benefit from any extra money This is becoming untenable as all schools achieve specialist status and with the wide variation in funding of similar schools in different parts of the country for reasons unconnected with specialist status Left wing critics argue that the specialist schools represent a drift away from the comprehensive ideal The main criticism that does hold up among the political noise is scepticism about student and parental choice If a school is unpopular , there is little likelihood that those in the surrounding area will have the space and flexibility to admit many individual students based simply on their choice of curriculum See also Academy \( English school \) Education in England References External links Specialist Schools and Academies Trust Category School types
