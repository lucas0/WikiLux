A sink estate is a British council housing estate , the origins of which lay in Wilson 's Labour government A Short History of the Labour Party by Alastair J Reid and Henry Pelling and is characterised by high levels of economic and social deprivation Such estates are not always high crime areas although there is a strong correlation between crime rates and sink estates in large urban areas Crime In the worst estates crime happens openly while victims are afraid to do anything or have no confidence that the police will act effectively Encouraging residents to report crime would help turn such estates round Council estate decline spawns new underclass Lack of coordination between police and housing departments can exacerbate problems In one estate women escaping domestic violence were regularly housed in the same flat Local criminals knew which flat and targeted the women to hook them onto harmful drugs and use the flat for criminal purposes The police and the council did not communicate over this New Statesman London Why the government must pledge to eliminate sink estates in ten years Forcing criminal types together creates a culture of crime where individuals have to be tough to survive Sink estates can be improved In one estate meetings were held three times weekly involving all the agencies that needed to share information Coordination improved and the estate was transformed In another Lambeth estate a police sergent familiar with the area organised job fairs , put gang members in touch with employers willing to take on those with criminal records Many were brought out of crime and into honest work In yet another estate arson stopped after local lads had played football with a local fire brigade team Locations Sink estates are found in urban areas around the country Many owe their existence to the historic need to rehouse the urban poor , either from Victorian slum housing during the 1920s and 1930s , or from low income housing demolished during the Blitz Many of the estates are dominated by tower blocks and garden cities , which have been blamed for discouraging strong communities and failing to provide adequate services to their residents Urban decay is commonplace , with accommodation often having considerably exceeded its intended lifespan In London there are sink estates in the North and East , the boroughs of Camden , Islington , Haringey , Newham , Tower Hamlets and Hackney The Harefield estate on the edge of Southampton was a sink estate in the last quarter of the twentieth century even though its crime rate was significantly lower than that of inner city areas In London , however , all the no go areas \( such as the estates in Peckham before its regeneration , Harlesden and Gospel Oak \) are sink estates The West Midlands has been home to numerous sink estates , although many of these have been regenerated or are in the process of regeneration These include the notorious Castle Vale in Birmingham , Galton Village in Smethwick , Friar Park in Wednesbury , Hateley Heath in West Bromwich , Low Hill in Wolverhampton , Priory Estate in Dudley , Chapel Street in Brierley Hill and Goscote in Walsall Sink estates in northern England include Stockbridge Village \( formerly Cantril Farm \) in Liverpool , Halton Moor in Leeds , the partly redeveloped Manor Estate in Sheffield and the now demolished Hulme Crescents in Manchester Origin The origin and meaning of the term 'sink estate' is unknown , although it is believed it may refer to being at the depths of society The phrase came into usage in the 1970s , and was probably a term coined by journalists It is now commonly used in media such as this BBC article Sink estate may refer to behavioural sink , which is a characteristic exhibited by animals forced to live in overcrowded conditions References Category Public housing in the United Kingdom
