LocationLogic Discontinued Products From time to time Autodesk discontinues some of the products in their portfolio Some of Autodesk 's retired products are listed here Volo View was a web enabled review and markup tool from Autodesk for engineering data , including support for Autodesk s DWG , DXF , and DWF formats Volo View enabled design teams to communicate ideas and review designs without access to AutoCAD software Autodesk discontinued sales of Volo View on May 1 , 2005 The latest version of the software , Volo View 3 , worked with the following file formats AutoCAD 2004 , DWG and DXF Design Web Format \( DWF 6 \) Autodesk Inventor 7 IPT , IAM , and IDW and raster files The functionality of this product is largely replaced by Autodesk Design Review Autodesk has also released a free product called DWG TrueView This product enables users to view and plot AutoCAD DWG and DXF files , and to publish these same files to the DWF file format Autodesk Animator Pro \( DOS \) and Autodesk Animator Studio \( Windows \) were products designed for cell based animation produced between the early to mid 1990s At the time Autodesk was also advertising a Autodesk Media product similar in description to Macromedia 's Director but this product was never released to the public Cyberspace by Autodesk was an early real time 3d environment capable of producing basic phong shaded walkthroughs of DXF format models in realtime No textures were supported , and the system appeared to support a maximum DXF model size of around 35kb A popular demo model of the Parthenon in Greece was shown around the US in a tour of the portable demo system complete with virtual reality goggles on the September 30th , 2004 Autodesk announced that QuickCAD would be discontinued after version 8 History Autodesk 's first notable product was AutoCAD , a CAD application designed to run on the systems known as microcomputers at the time , including those running the 8 bit CP M operating system and two of the new 16 bit systems , the Victor 9000 and the IBM Personal Computer \( PC \) This CAD tool allowed users to create detailed technical drawings , and was affordable to many smaller design , engineering , and architecture companies Release 2 1 of AutoCAD , released in 1986 , included AutoLisp , a built in Lisp interpreter initially based on XLISP http www fourmilab ch autofile www section2 115 4 html This opened the door for third party developers to extend AutoCAD 's functionality , to address a wide range of vertical markets strengthening AutoCAD 's market penetration Subsequent to AutoCAD Release 12 , the company stopped supporting the Unix environment and the Apple Macintosh platform After AutoCAD Release 14 , first shipped in 1997 , Autodesk discontinued development under MS DOS , and focused exclusively on Microsoft Windows AutoCAD has grown to become the most widely used CAD program for 2D non specialized applications The native file formats written by AutoCAD , DXF and DWG , are also widely used for CAD data interoperability In the early 1990s , Autodesk started to develop specialty versions of AutoCAD , targeted to broad industry segments , including architecture , civil engineering , and manufacturing Since the late 1990s , the company has added a number of significant non AutoCAD based products , including Revit , a parametric building modeling application \( acquired in 2002 , from Massachusetts based Revit Technologies for 133 million \) , and Inventor , an internally developed parametric mechanical design CAD application On January 10 , 2006 , Autodesk acquired Alias , with its automitive styling and digital content creation applications , for 197 million USD On August 6 , 2007 , Autodesk announced the acquisition of Skymatter Inc , developer of Mudbox On August 28 , 2007 , Autodesk announced the acquisition of California based PlassoTech , developers of CAE applications Terms of the transaction were not disclosed Autodesk 's products compete against products from several companies , including MicroStation from Bentley Systems , VectorWorks from Nemetschek , ArchiCAD from Graphisoft , SolidWorks , owned by Dassault Systemes , Solid Edge from Siemens UGS PLM Software , 12d Model , owned by 12d Solutions , Pro E from PTC , and SDS 2 owned by Design Data References External links Autodesk Official site
