The term Byzantine is used to describe any work , law , or organization that is excessively complex or difficult to understand \( see also Baroque \) The term was first applied to the eastern Roman Empire by historians in the 16th century , decades after the Fall of Constantinople to the forces of Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire on 29 May , 1453 The Byzantine Empire , sometimes known during its early phase as the Eastern Roman Empire , acquired a negative reputation among historians of the 18th century and 19th century because of the complex organization of its ministries and the elaborateness of its court ceremonies , as well as for its supposed lack of backbone in martial affairs Although many of the Byzantine emperors of the Middle and Late Empire were full time military commanders several of them being men of letters as well and might well have shown little patience with elaborate court ceremonies This reputation originated , according to By the 18th century refinement and polite manners were no longer considered effeminate , so writers like Gibbon found it in the scholarly works of the emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos \( 905 959 , reigned 913 959 \) , and seized upon the pedantic style of this invalid and bookish ruler , who was forced to pass most of his reign as a figurehead Exploiting this source to confirm his own preconceptions , Gibbon thus gave new life to an oversimplified view of a decadent Byzantium In the 19th century , this reputation was cemented and quite obvious in the writings of the historian William Lecky Of that Byzantine empire , the universal verdict of history is that it constitutes , without a single exception , the most thoroughly base and despicable form that civilization has yet assumed There has been no other enduring civilization so absolutely destitute of all forms and elements of greatness , and none to which the epithet mean may be so emphatically applied The history of the empire is a monotonous story of the intrigues of priests , eunuchs , and women , of poisonings , of conspiracies , of uniform ingratitude \( A history of European Morals from Augustus to Charlemagne 2 vols \( London 1869 \) II , 13f \) , as cited , for example , by Elizabeth Jeffreys , John Haldon , Robin Cormack , The Oxford Handbook of Byzantine Studies , Oxford University Press , 2009 , ISBN 0199252467 , Google Print , p 9 Likewise , the term Byzantine also suggests a penchant for intrigue , plots and assassinations and an overall unstable political state of affairs In fact , the Empire was among the more stable political entities in history , surviving \( albeit precariously and with continually diminishing territory \) for over a millennium after the Fall of Rome ended its Western counterpart Its famous intrigues and turmoils were probably equal to that of contemporary Western Europe 's unruly feudal states \( and probably less when one includes the squabbles that turned into outright war \) , and occurred most often during relatively brief interregnums between strong dynasties The very stability of the imperial state , however , probably undermined the creative impulses and innovation that characterized the early centuries of the Byzantine civilization , thus contributing to its eventual downfall See also Byzantine fault tolerance Byzantinism References Further reading John Haldon , Byzantium A History , ISBN 0 7524 2343 6 Steven Runciman , The Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and his Reign , University Press \( Cambridge \) , 1990 Edward Gibbon , The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , chapter 53 Category Ancient Roman Empire Category Byzantine Empire de Byzantinismus
