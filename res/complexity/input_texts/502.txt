Adaptive Multi Rate WideBand \( AMR WB \) is a patented speech coding standard developed after the AMR using similar technology as ACELP The codec provides excellent speech quality due to wider speech bandwidth of 50 7000 Hz compared to narrowband speech codecs which in general are optimized for POTS wireline quality of 300 3400 Hz AMR WB is codified as G 722 2 , an ITU T standard speech codec A common file extension for AMR WB is awb AMR modes AMR WB operates like AMR with 9 different bit rates The lowest bit rate providing excellent speech quality in a clean environment is 12 65 kbit s Higher bit rates are useful in background noise conditions and in the case of music Also lower bit rates of 6 60 and 8 85 provide reasonable quality especially if compared to narrow band codecs All modes are sampled at 16 kHz and processed at 12 8 kHz The bit rates are the following Mandatory multi rate configuration 6 60 kbit s \( used for circuit switched GSM and UMTS connections should only be used temporarily during bad radio connections and is not considered wideband speech \) 8 85 kbit s \( used for circuit switched GSM and UMTS connections should only be used temporarily during bad radio connections and is not considered wideband speech provides quality equal to G 722 at 48 kbit s for clean speech \) 12 65 kbit s \( main anchor bitrate used for circuit switched GSM and UMTS connections offers superior audio quality to AMR at and above this bit rate provides quality equal to or better than G722 at 56 kbit s for clean speech \) Higher bitrates for speech in adverse background noise environments , combined speech and music , and multi party conferencing 14 25 kbit s 15 85 kbit s 18 25 kbit s 19 85 kbit s 23 05 kbit s \( not targeted for full rate GSM channels \) 23 85 kbit s \( provides quality equal to G722 at 64 kbit s for clean speech not targeted for full rate GSM channels \) Configurations for 3GPP When used in mobile phone networks , there are three different configurations \( combinations of bitrates \) that may be used for voice channels Configuration A 6 6 , 8 85 , and 12 65 kbit s \( Mandatory multi rate configuration \) Configuration B 6 6 , 8 85 , 12 65 , and 15 85 kbit s Configuration C 6 6 , 8 85 , 12 65 , and 23 85 kbit s This limitation was designed to simplify the negotiation of bitrate between the handset and the base station , thus vastly simplifying the implementation and testing All other bitrates can still be used for other purposes in mobile phone networks , including multimedia messaging , streaming audio , etc Deployment AMR WB has been standardized by a mobile phone manufacturer consortium for future usage in networks such as UMTS Its speech quality is high , but older networks will have to be upgraded to support a wide band codec In October 2006 , first AMR WB tests were conducted in a deployed network by T Mobile in Germany , in cooperation with Ericsson http www slashphone com 74 5630 html http www t mobile de unternehmen presse 0 , 1807 , 17596 , 00 html T Mobile press release \( in German \) Nokia developed VMR WB codec for CDMA2000 networks , which is fully interoperable with 3GPP AMR WB AMR WB is also widely adapted format in mobile handsets for tones Licensing G 722 2 is licensed by VoiceAge Corporation See also AMR WB RFC 4867 References External links Deep Inside the Network , Episode 2 AMR WB Skype like Audio Quality for Mobile Networks Wideband Speech Coding Standards and Applications Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects ITU T Implementors' Guide for G 722 2 Category Audio codecs Category Speech codecs Category ITU T recommendations fr G 722 2 fi AMR WB
