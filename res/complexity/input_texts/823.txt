The Georgians \( , kartvelebi \) are an ethnic group that originates in Georgia , where they constitute a majority of the population Large Georgian communities are also present throughout Russia , European Union , United States , and South America The majority of Georgians are Orthodox Christian and largely adhere to the national autocephalous Georgian Orthodox Church , which originated in the 4th century There are also Georgian Catholic and Muslim communities in Tbilisi and Adjara Descending from some of the earliest settlers in the south of Caucasus , the Georgian people went through a complex process of ethnic consolidation and nation making It currently comprises a diverse set of local sub ethnic communities , each with its characteristic traditions , manners and dialect or in the case of Mingrelians and Svans language The Georgian language , with its own alphabet and long written tradition going back to the 5th century , is the language of literacy and education of all Georgians living in Georgia as well as the official language of the country Georgian , Mingrelian and Svan , together with Laz spoken by the related Laz people form the Kartvelian language family Strategically located on the crossroads between Europe and Asia , the Georgian people have fought to protect their Christian identity in the face of immense cultural pressure from the neighboring Muslim empires By the early 11th century they formed a unified kingdom which emerged as a dominant regional power until it was weakened by internal divisions following the death of George V the Brilliant , the last of the great kings of Georgia To ensure its survival as a Christian kingdom Georgia was soon forced to forge an alliance with the Russian Empire which was viewed as a replacement for the fallen Eastern Roman Empire , Georgia 's traditional ally Eventually being annexed by Russia in 1801 , Georgians briefly regained national independence from 1918 to 1921 , and finally , in 1991 from the Soviet Union Etymology Georgians call themselves Kartvelebi \( \) , their land Sakartvelo \( \) , and their language Kartuli \( \) According to The Georgian Chronicles , the ancestor of the Kartvelian people was Kartlos , the great grandson of the Biblical Japheth Ancient Greeks \( Strabo , Herodotus , Plutarch , Homer , etc \) and Romans \( Titus Livius , Cornelius Tacitus , etc \) referred to early eastern Georgians as Iberians \( Iberoi in some Greek sources \) and Mingrelians Lazes as Colchians Braund , David Georgia in Antiquity A History of Colchis and Transcaucasian Iberia , 550 BC AD 562 , pp 17 18 Origins Most historians and scholars of Georgia as well as anthropologists , archaeologists and linguists tend to agree that the ancestors of modern Georgians inhabited the southern Caucasus and northern Anatolia since the Neolithic period The Georgians , David Marshal Lang , p 19 Scholars usually refer to them as Proto Kartvelian \( Proto Georgians such as Colchians and Iberians \) tribes The Georgians , David Marshal Lang , p 66 Even the Bible makes mention of Tubal cain , who is associated with proto Georgian tribes Some European historians of the 19th century \( for example , Wilhelm von Humboldt and Paul Kretschmer \) as well as Georgian scholars \( R Gordeziani , S Kaukhchishvili and Z Gamsakhurdia \) came to the conclusion that Proto Kartvelians might be related linguistically and culturally to the indigenous \( pre Indo European \) peoples of ancient Europe including the Etruscans , Pelasgians and Proto Basques The Georgian people in antiquity have been known to the ancient Greeks and Romans as Colchians and Iberians Georgia A Sovereign Country of the Caucasus , Roger Rosen , p 18The Making of the Georgian Nation , Ronald Grigor Suny , p 4 East Georgian tribes of Tibarenians Iberians formed their kingdom in 7th century BCE However , western Georgian tribes \( Moschians , Suanians , Mingrelians and others \) established the first Georgian state of Colchis before the foundation of the Iberian Kingdom in the east Cyril Toumanoff , Studies in Christian Caucasian History , p 80 According to the numerous scholars of Georgia , the formations of these two early Georgian kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia , resulted in the consolidation and uniformity of the Georgian nation Cyril Toumanoff , Studies in Christian Caucasian History , p 58 Proto Georgian tribes The ancient Jewish chronicle by Josephus mentions Georgians as Iberes who were also called Thobel \( Tubal \) The Complete Works , Jewish Antiquities , Josephus , Book 1 , p 57 Daiaeni in Assyrian sources and Taokhoi in Greek , lived in the northeastern part of Anatolia , a region that once was part of Georgia This ancient tribe is considered by many scholars as ancestors of Georgians The Georgians of today still refer to this region , which now belongs to present day Turkey , as Tao Klarjeti Some people there still speak Georgian The Georgians , David Marshal Lang , p 58 Colchians in the ancient western Georgian \( Mingrelian Laz \) Kingdom of Colchis First mentioned in the Assyrian annals of Tiglath Pileser I and in the annals of Urartian king Sarduri II Also included western proto Georgian tribe of the Meskhetians The Georgians , David Marshal Lang , p 59 However , in the case of many tribes , this is often disputed among scholars , as many claim that many Colchian tribes were ancestors of the modern Abkhaz and Abaza , especially the Abasgoi , and assert that Colchis was an ethnically heterogeneous nation Iberians also known as Tiberians or Tiberanians , in the eastern Georgian Kingdom of Iberia Both Colchians and Iberians played an important role in the ethnic and cultural formation of the modern Georgian nation Charles Burney and David

western Georgia BRAUND , D , Georgia in antiquity a history of Colchis and Transcaucasian Iberia 550 BC AD 562 , Oxford University Press , 1996 The ancient Greeks knew western Georgia as Colchis , and it featured in the Greek legend of Jason and the Argonauts , who travelled there in search of the Golden Fleece Since 2000 BC , north western Colchis was inhabited by the Svan and Zan peoples of the Georgian tribes In the eastern part of Georgia , there was a struggle for the leadership among the various Georgian confederations during the 6th 4th centuries BC which was finally won by the Kartlian tribes from the region of Mtskheta in Iberia According to The Georgian Chronicles , the Kingdom of Kartli \( known as Iberia in the Greek Roman literature \) was founded around 300 BC by Parnavaz I , the first ruler of the Parnavazid dynasty Between 653 and 333 BC , both Colchis and Iberia were successfully surviving in fight against Median and later Persian Empire At the end of the 3rd century BC , southern Iberia saw the armies of Alexander the Great who established a vast Greco Macedonian empire to the south of the Caucasus thumb 100px left Saint Nino is credited for conversion of Georgia to Christianity in 327 Between the early 2nd century BC and the late 2nd century AD , both Colchis and Iberia , together with the neighbor countries , became an arena of long and devastating conflicts between major local powers Rome , Armenia , and the short lived Kingdom of Pontus As a result of the brilliant Roman campaigns of Pompey and Lucullus , the Georgian kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia came under direct Roman rule However , during the reign of the Emperor Trajan , Caucasian Iberia became a long lasting ally of the Roman Empire The former Kingdom of Colchis was re organized by the Romans into the province of Lazicum ruled by Roman legati Eastern Georgian Kingdom of Iberia became one of the first states in the world to convert to Christianity in 327 AD , when King of Iberia Mirian II established it as the official state religion In the middle of the 4th century , both Lazica \( former Kingdom of Colchis \) , and Iberia , adopted Christianity as their official religion At the end of the 5th century , Prince Vakhtang I Gorgasali orchestrated an anti Persian uprising and restored Iberian statehood proclaiming himself the King The armies of Vakhtang launched several campaigns against both Persia and the Byzantine Empire Medieval Georgia The first decades of the 9th century saw the rise of a new Georgian state Ashot Courapalate , of the royal family of Bagrationi , restored the Christian rule over the territories formerly captured by Arabs during their conquest of southernmost extremities of Europe This set the stage for the formation of the first united Georgian monarchy at the end of the 10th century when Curopalate David invaded the Eastern Georgia Three years later , after the death of his uncle Theodosius the Blind , King of Egrisi Abkhazia , David 's heir Bagrat III inherited the Abkhazian throne In 1001 , Bagrat also incorporated Tao Klarjeti \( Curopalatinate of Iberia \) into his domain as a result of David s death In 1008 1010 , Bagrat III of Georgia Bagrat annexed the easternmost parts of the present day Georgia , thus becoming the first King of the united Georgia both eastern and western The struggle against the Seljuk invaders in Georgia was led by the young King David IV of the Bagrationi royal family who inherited the throne in 1089 at the age of 16 after the abdication of his father George II of Georgia In 1121 , Seljuk Sultan Mahmud declared Jihad on Georgia and sent a strong army under one of his famous generals Al Ghazee to fight the Georgians Although significantly outnumbered by the Turks , Georgians managed to defeat the invaders at the battle of Didgori and in 1122 took over Tbilisi to make it Georgia s capital As a result , mostly Christian populated Ghishi Kabala area in western Shirvan \( relic of once prosperous Albanian Kingdom \) was annexed by Georgia while the rest of already Islamized Shirvan became Georgia s client state That same year a big portion of Armenia was liberated by David s troops and fell into Georgian hands as well Thus , in 1124 , David also became the King of Armenians incorporating Northern Armenia into Georgian Crown lands In King David died leaving Georgia with the status of a strong regional power In Georgia , King David is called the builder However , the most glorious sovereign of Georgia of that period was definitely Queen Tamar \( David s great granddaughter \) The reign of Queen Tamar was the peak of Georgia s might in the whole history of the nation The Empire of Trebizond was heavily dependent of Georgia for more than two hundred years In 1210 , Georgian armies invaded northern Persia \( modern day Iranian Azerbaijan \) putting part of the conquered territory under Georgian protectorate That was the maximal extent of Georgia throughout her history Georgian historians often refer to her as Queen Tamar the Great The period between the early 12th and the early 13th centuries and especially , the era of Tamar the Great , can truly be considered as the golden age of Georgia Besides the political and military achievements , it was marked by the development of Georgian culture including the architecture , literature , philosophy and sciences The Golden age of Georgia left a magnificent legacy of great cathedrals , brilliant romantic poetry and literature , and the epic poem The Knight in the Panther 's Skin revered by all Georgians since its creation for its artistic and philosophical virtue , the glorification of the Christian Orthodox values as well as chivalry , honor , compassion and romantic love This Golden Age was interrupted at its peak by the Mongol Invasion in the 13th century AD After that time , the Georgian feudal state entered an era of decline until reaching a new height under George V the Brilliant Modern history In the 19th century , Georgia , on the verge of annihilation by its powerful southern rivals , was annexed by the Russian Empire A few decades later , Georgian society produced a modernist nationalistic elite under the guidance of Ilia Chavchavadze , which united Georgian society around the dream of the restoration of their once glorious state In 1918 , this dream was fulfilled and the First Republic was established This democratic experiment was short lived , as in 1921 a Bolshevik government was installed with the support of the invading Red Army The first years of independence after the dissolution of the USSR were characterized by political instability and civil conflicts The first wave of reforms initiated in 1995 was only partially successful Political corruption resulted in economic decline and institutional inefficiency , which led to grave political crisis In November 2003 , the Rose Revolution a mass non violent public disobedience campaign forced the government , which had tried to falsify elections , to resign A new wave of systemic reforms started after the election of the new Government Ethnographic subdivisions 260px thumb Georgian youth in traditional costumes The largest ethnic group within the broader Georgian ethnicity is the \( transliterated kartveli , plural , kartvelebi \) , which comprises the majority of the population of Georgia The other major subdivisions within the Georgian ethnicity include the Mingrelians \( \) , who live predominantly in northwestern Georgia \( Samegrelo \) and theSvans \( \) of the Svaneti region of Georgia and Abkhazes who live mostly in Abkhazeti region These four ethnic groups within the greater Georgian ethnicity are differentiated by language The Kartveli speak Kartuli \( what the English speaking world calls Georgian \) , the Mingrelians speak Megrelian , the Laz speak Laz , and the Svans speak Svan These four related languages comprise the entirety of the South Caucasian language group The majority of Mingrelians and Svans are bilingual in their native language and in Kartuli , while the majority of the Laz are bilingual in their native language and either Kartuli or Turkish Within the group called Kartveli , Georgians further distinguish themselves into regional ethnographic subgroups The Megrelians \( \) The Laz people \( \) The Svans \( \) The Imeretians \( \) The Gurians \( \) The Ajarians \( \) The Meskhetians \( \) The Lechkhumeli \( \) The Rachveli \( \) The Kartlians \( \) The Kakhetians \( \) The Khevsurians \( \) The Tushi \( \) The Pshaveli \( \) The Mokhevians \( \) The Ingilo \( \) The Fereydanians \( \) The Abkhazians \( \) These subgroups , however , exist for historical and geographical reasons each would consider itself to be Kartveli ,
