NOTOC Magnetic Fields \( French title Les Chants Magn tiques \) is the third album by Jean Michel Jarre , released in 1981 on Disques Dreyfus The album was one of the first records to use sampling as a musical element and represents a departure from the sound of Jarre 's previous efforts For this album Jarre was partly inspired by the works of Andy Warhol and a fascination with the reproducibility of digital sound The long first track consists of three distinct movements , the slower second movement being heavily laden with sample work , foreshadowing the sound of Jarre 's 1984 album Zoolook The album reached 6 in the UK charts and 98 in the US charts Album Titles The album has official titles in both French and English The French title , Les Chants Magn tiques is a play on words Literally translated it means Magnetic Songs Babelfish , altavista com , French to English translation carried out 2006 11 05 1989 , The Collins Pocket Reference French Dictionary , William Collins Sons Co Ltd , ISBN 0 00 433255 5 or Magnetic Singing However , when spoken aloud , it sounds very similar to Les Champs Magn tiques \( literally , Magnetic Fields \) , due to the French words chants \( songs or singing \) and champs \( fields \) being homophones As this is not the case in English , the word play present in the French title could not be translated , and a non literal translation was chosen instead Track listing Magnetic Fields Part 1 17 49 Magnetic Fields Part 2 3 59 Magnetic Fields Part 3 4 15 Magnetic Fields Part 4 6 18 Magnetic Fields Part 5 3 30 Equipment ARP 2600 Electro Harmonix Echoflanger Elka 707 Eminent 310U EMS Synthi AKS EMS Vocoder 1000 Fairlight CMI Korg KR 55 Korg VC 10 MDB polysequencer Moog Taurus Pedal Synthesizer Oberheim OB X EMS Synthi VCS3 Trivia An excerpt of Magnetic Fields Part 1 is used as the interval signal for a shortwave numbers station An audio clip is available here The same movement was also used as the theme music for the American television series Bare Essence \( 1982 \) Footnotes Category 1981 albums Category Jean Michel Jarre albums fr Les Chants Magn tiques pl Les Chants Magn tiques sv Les Chants Magn tiques
