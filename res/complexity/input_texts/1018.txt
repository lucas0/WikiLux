Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that is a fork of Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash is a spin off or altcoin that was created in 2017 In 2018 Bitcoin Cash subsequently split into two cryptocurrencies Bitcoin Cash , and Bitcoin SV Bitcoin Cash is sometimes also referred to as Bcash Bcash Nickname Sources History Rising fees on the Bitcoin network contributed to a push by some in the community to create a hard fork to increase the blocksize This push came to a head in July 2017 when some members of the bitcoin community including Roger Ver felt that adopting BIP 91 without increasing the block size limit favored people who wanted to treat bitcoin as a digital investment rather than as a transactional currency This push by some to increase the block size met a resistance Since its inception up to July 2017 , Bitcoin users had maintained a common set of rules for the cryptocurrency Eventually , a group of bitcoin activists , investors , entrepreneurs , developers and largely China based miners were unhappy with Bitcoin 's proposed SegWit improvement plans meant to increase capacity and pushed forward alternative plans for a split which created Bitcoin Cash The proposed split included a plan to increase the number of transactions its ledger can process by increasing the block size limit to eight megabytes The would be hard fork with an expanded block size limit was described by hardware manufacturer Bitmain in June 2017 as a contingency plan should the bitcoin community decide to fork the first implementation of the software was proposed under the name Bitcoin ABC at a conference that month In July 2017 , the Bitcoin Cash name was proposed by mining pool ViaBTC The change , called a fork , took effect on 1 August 2017 As a result , the bitcoin ledger called the blockchain and the cryptocurrency split in two A Hong Kong newspaper likened this to a new version of word processing software saying Bryan Kelly , a stock analyst likened it to a software upgrade At the time of the software upgrade \( also known as a fork \) anyone owning bitcoin was also in possession of the same number of Bitcoin Cash units The technical difference between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin is that Bitcoin Cash allows larger blocks in its blockchain than Bitcoin , which in theory allows it to process more transactions per second Bitcoin Cash was the first of the Bitcoin forks , in which software development teams modified the original Bitcoin computer code and released coins with Bitcoin in their names , with the goal of creating money out of thin air In relation to Bitcoin it is characterized variously as a spin off , a strand , a product of a hard fork , an offshoot , a clone , a second version or an altcoin On 1 August 2017 Bitcoin Cash began trading at about 240 , while bitcoin traded at about 2 , 700 A key difference of opinion between bitcoin cash and bitcoin camps was over the running of nodes Bitcoin supporters wanted to keep blocks small so that nodes could be operated with less resources , while some bitcoin cash supporters find it acceptable that \( due to large block sizes \) , nodes might only be run by universities , private companies and nonprofits In 2018 Bitcoin Core developer Cory Fields found a bug in the Bitcoin ABC software that would have allowed an attacker to create a block causing a chain split Fields notified the development team about it and the bug was fixed Controversy In 2017 there were two factions of bitcoin supporters , those that supported large blocks and those who preferred small blocks The Bitcoin Cash faction favors the use of its currency as a medium of exchange for commerce while the Bitcoin supporting faction view bitcoin 's primary use as that of a store of value Some Bitcoin supporters like to call Bitcoin Cash Bcash , Btrash , or simply a scam , while Bitcoin Cash advocates insist that their implementation is the pure form of Bitcoin Samson Mow of Blockstream pointed to Bitcoin Cash 's use of the Bitcoin name as a source of animosity between the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash camps Emin G n Sirer , a professor at Cornell stated that Bitcoin Cash was focused on use and Bitcoin was enormously focused on store of value Trading and usage thumb Number of Bitcoin Cash transactions per month \( logarithmic scale \) Bitcoin Cash trades on digital currency exchanges including Bitstamp , Coinbase , Gemini , Kraken , Bitfinex , and ShapeShift using the Bitcoin Cash name and the BCH ticker symbol for the cryptocurrency On 26 March 2018 , OKEx removed all Bitcoin Cash trading pairs except for BCH BTC , BCH ETH and BCH USDT due to inadequate liquidity , daily transaction numbers for Bitcoin Cash are about one tenth of those of bitcoin Coinbase listed Bitcoin Cash on December 19 , 2017 and the coinbase platform experienced price abnormalites that led to an insider trading investigation By November 2017 the value of Bitcoin Cash , which had been as high as 900 , had fallen to around 300 , much of that due to people who had originally held Bitcoin selling off the Bitcoin Cash they received at the hard fork On 20 December 2017 it reached an intraday high of 4 , 355 62 and then fell 88 to 519 12 on 23 August 2018 As of August 2018 , Bitcoin Cash payments are supported by payment service providers such as BitPay , Coinify and GoCoin Difficulty adjustment algorithm Both Bitcoin , as well as Bitcoin Cash , use a proof of work algorithm to timestamp every new block The proof of work algorithm used is the same in both cases It can be described as a partial inversion of a hash function Additionally , both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash target a new block to be generated every ten minutes on average The time needed to calculate a new block is influenced by a parameter called the mining difficulty If the total amount of mining power increases , an increase of the mining difficulty can keep the block time roughly constant Vice versa , if the mining power decreases , a decrease of the mining difficulty can keep the block time roughly constant To keep the block generation time equal to ten minutes on average , both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash use an algorithm adjusting the mining difficulty parameter This algorithm is called the difficulty adjustment algorithm \( DAA \) Originally , both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash used the same difficulty adjustment algorithm , adjusting the mining difficulty parameter every 2016 blocks Since 1 August 2017 , Bitcoin Cash also used an addition to the DAA , called an Emergency Difficulty Adjustment \( EDA \) algorithm EDA was used alongside the original DAA and it was designed to decrease the mining difficulty of Bitcoin Cash by 20 , if the time difference between 6 successive blocks was greater than 12 hours EDA adjustments caused instabilities in mining difficulty of the Bitcoin Cash system , resulting in Bitcoin Cash being thousands of blocks ahead of Bitcoin To address the problem with stability , a change of the Bitcoin Cash DAA was implemented and the EDA canceled The change took effect on 13 November 2017 After the change , the Bitcoin Cash DAA adjusts the mining difficulty after each block To calculate the difficulty for a new block , the Bitcoin Cash DAA uses a moving window of last 144 blocks A group of researchers demonstrated that , as of June 2019 , Bitcoin DAA fails to generate new blocks at a constant rate as long as the hash supply is elastic In contrast to that , the group demonstrated that Bitcoin Cash DAA is stable even when the cryptocurrency price is volatile and the supply of hash power is highly elastic 2018 split to create Bitcoin SV thumb Number of Bitcoin SV transactions per month \( logarithmic scale \) On 15 November 2018 , a hard fork chain split of Bitcoin Cash occurred between two rival factions called Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV On 15 November 2018 Bitcoin Cash traded at about 289 and Bitcoin SV traded at about 96 50 , down from 425 01 on 14 November for the un split Bitcoin Cash The split originated from what was described as a civil war in two competing bitcoin cash camps The first camp , supported by entrepreneur Roger Ver and Jihan Wu of Bitmain , promoted the software entitled Bitcoin ABC \( short for Adjustable Blocksize Cap \) which would maintain the block size at 32MB The second camp led by Craig Steven Wright and billionaire Calvin Ayre put forth a competing software version Bitcoin SV , short for Bitcoin Satoshi 's Vision , that would increase the block size limit to 128MB See also Bitcoin scalability problem Cryptocurrency splits List of bitcoin forks List of
