Total Goals 974 Average Goals per game 2 56 Season preview Arsenal were the favourites to defend their title after finishing the previous season unbeaten , but they also faced competition in the form of regular challengers Manchester United and Chelsea , the latter under the new management of Portuguese Jos Mourinho , who had just won the Champions League with Porto Liverpool also had a new manager in Spaniard Rafael Ben tez , who had just won La Liga and the UEFA Cup with Valencia and were expected to challenge for the title too Another managerial change at a club aiming for the top was at Tottenham Hotspur , who appointed Jacques Santini , who had just led France to the quarter finals of the 2004 European Championship At the other end of the table , amongst those tipped for relegation were Norwich City , Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion , having all just been promoted from the First Division \( which was rebranded this season as the Championship \) Everton , Manchester City , Blackburn Rovers and Portsmouth were also tipped to struggle , the first three finishing just outside the relegation places the previous season and Portsmouth being in their second season Title contention Although Chelsea led the Premiership virtually all season long , they faced stiff competition from eventual runners up Arsenal and third placed Manchester United , both of whom achieved Champions League qualification The title seemed to be heading towards Highbury once again after Arsenal stretched their unbeaten run to 49 matches to lead Chelsea by five points and Manchester United by eleven as they travelled to Old Trafford on 24 October , only to controversially lose 2 0 Arsenal 's form then plummeted dramatically as Chelsea continued in great form and Manchester United kickstarted their campaign , at one stage going into second position after defeating Arsenal 4 2 at Highbury on 1 February \( Arsenal 's first home defeat since being beaten 3 2 by Leeds United in 2003 \) However , as Chelsea steamrollered all those before them with their powerful style , United 's form dipped after a goalless home draw to Blackburn and a 2 0 defeat to lowly Norwich allowed a resurgent Arsenal to pass United , taking second place The fourth Champions League place went to Everton , who had been among the relegation favourites after the early season sale of striker and PFA Young Player of the Year Wayne Rooney to Manchester United this result was even more amazing considering Everton had finished in 17th place the previous season Fifth placed Liverpool would normally have qualified for the UEFA Cup , but eventually were allowed by UEFA to defend their Champions League title despite finishing outside the top four , forfeiting the UEFA Cup slot given to the fifth placed team Liverpool had to enter in the first qualifying round , where they defeated Welsh champions TNS The teams in sixth place and seventh place , Bolton Wanderers and Middlesbrough , achieved UEFA Cup qualification as both the FA Cup runners up \( Manchester United \) and League Cup winners \( Chelsea \) had qualified for the Champions League via their league position Liverpool 's entry into the Champions League did not affect either Bolton Wanderers' or Middlesbrough 's UEFA Cup entry as they both achieved their best finishes in the Premiership to date The relegation dog fight For the first time since the advent of the Premier League in 1992 , no team was mathematically relegated before the final day of the season In each of the last three weekends of the season , the team that was bottom of the table at the start of the weekend finished it outside the drop zone The final round of the season started on 15 May with West Bromwich Albion at the bottom , Southampton and Crystal Palace one point ahead and Norwich City a further point ahead , in the last safe spot West Brom , who had been bottom of the table and eight points from safety on Christmas Day , did their part by defeating Portsmouth at home 2 0 Norwich , the only side to have their fate completely in their own hands , lost 6 0 at Fulham and went down Southampton lost 2 1 at home to Manchester United and were relegated after 27 years in the top flight Palace , away to Charlton Athletic , were leading 2 1 after 71 minutes , but with eight minutes to go , Charlton 's Jonathan Fortune equalised to relegate Palace Thus , West Brom stayed up , becoming the first club in Premier League history to avoid relegation after being bottom of the table at Christmas At the end of the 90 minutes in all four matches , cameras focused on West Brom 's home ground , The Hawthorns , as confirmation of other results began to filter through Once the realisation dawned on the players and fans that survival had been achieved , a mass pitch invasion was sparked , with huge celebrations The Portsmouth fans joined in the celebrations as , through losing , they had helped relegate arch rivals Southampton The defeat itself mattered little to Portsmouth , as they would be unable to improve on their final position of 16th due to 15th placed Blackburn Rovers' greater points tally Managerial changes Blackburn Rovers appointed Wales boss Mark Hughes as manager in September , following the departure of Graeme Souness to Newcastle United Chelsea sacked Claudio Ranieri and replaced him with UEFA Champions League winning coach Jos Mourinho Liverpool appointed Valencia 's UEFA Cup winning coach Rafael Ben tez as successor to G rard Houllier , who was sacked Manchester City parted company with manager Kevin Keegan in late March and replaced him with first team coach Stuart Pearce Newcastle United sacked manager Sir Bobby Robson at the end of August and replaced him with Blackburn 's Graeme Souness Portsmouth parted company with Harry Redknapp in November and replaced him with executive director Velimir Zajec He was also replaced by Alain Perrin in March Southampton parted company with Paul Sturrock early in the season he had lasted less than six months in the job He was replaced by Steve Wigley , but he was sacked in November and replaced by Harry Redknapp Tottenham Hotspur appointed former French national coach Jacques Santini as the new manager during pre season Santini left in November , citing personal problems , and was replaced by his assistant Martin Jol West Bromwich Albion sacked Gary Megson in October after Megson notified the club he would not be extending his contract beyond the end of the season He was replaced him with former England captain and Manchester United legend Bryan Robson Top scorers RankScorerTeamGoals1 Thierry HenryArsenal252 Andy JohnsonCrystal Palace213 Robert Pir sArsenal144 Jermain DefoeTottenham Hotspur13 Jimmy Floyd
