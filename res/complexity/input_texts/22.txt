approval of US leadership in the entire Middle East and North Africa region However , for decades prior to the 2011 Libyan Civil War , the countries were not on good terms and engaged each other in several military skirmishes The Libyan government of Muammar Gaddafi funded terror operations against the United States , most notably the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing , to which the United States retaliated by bombing Libya , and the 1988 Lockerbie bombing When the Libyan civil war broke out in 2011 , the United States took part in a military intervention in the conflict , aiding anti Gaddafi

meeting King Idris of Libya in 1957 The king sought cordial relations with the U S Following Italy 's colonial occupation of Libya and the German occupation during World War II the U S leased the strategically important Wheelus Air Base from the Kingdom of Libya The United States supported the UN resolution providing for Libyan independence in 1951 and accordingly raised the status of its office at Tripoli from a consulate general to a legation Libya opened a legation in Washington , D C , in 1954 Both countries subsequently raised their missions to embassy level Oil was discovered in Libya in 1959 , and what had been one of the world 's poorest countries became comparatively wealthy The United States continued a generally warm relationship with Libya and pursued policies centered on interests in operations at Wheelus Air Base and the considerable U S oil interests During the early 1960s , many children of U S oil personnel sent to develop the oil field installations and pipelines were allowed to attend the high school facility at Wheelus , typically riding buses from residential areas in or near Tripoli Classes often had to pause briefly while large aircraft were taking off The strategic value of Wheelus as a bomber base declined with the development of nuclear missiles and Wheelus served as a tactical fighter training facility in the 1960s In September 1969 King Idris I was overthrown by a group of military officers centered around Muammar Gaddafi Before the revolution , the U S and Libya had already reached agreement on U S withdrawal from Wheelus this proceeded according to plan , and the facility was turned over to the new Libyan authorities on June 11 , 1970 Libya under Gaddafi \( 1969 2011 \) After Muammar Gaddafi 's 1969 coup , U S Libyan

prosecutors in the U S and Scotland for their involvement in the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 near Lockerbie , Scotland In January 1992 , the UN Security Council approved Resolution 731 demanding that Libya surrender the suspects , cooperate with the Pan Am 103 and UTA 772 investigations , pay compensation to the victims' families , and cease all support for terrorism Libya 's refusal to comply led to the approval of UNSC Resolution 748 on March 31 , 1992 , imposing sanctions designed to bring about Libyan compliance Continued Libyan defiance led to passage of Security Council Resolution 883 a limited assets freeze and an embargo on selected oil equipment in November 1993 In March 2003 , Tripoli secretly approached Washington and London with an offer to reveal the scope of its WMD programs This led to covert negotiations in Libya , which in turn resulted , on December 19 , 2003 , in the country 's public disclosure of the extent of their WMD research and capabilities UN sanctions had been lifted on September 12 , 2003 , after Libya fulfilled all remaining UNSCR requirements pertaining to the Lockerbie bombing , including renunciation of terrorism ,

the UN Susan Rice successfully pressured Russia and China not to veto the resolution , and it passed on March 17 , 2011 The US military played an instrumental role in the initial stage of the intervention , suppressing Libyan air defenses and coordinating international forces in the establishment of a no fly zone over Libya , before handing command responsibility to NATO and taking a supporting role in the campaign of air strikes against pro Gaddafi forces The intervention severely weakened the Gaddafi regime and aided the rebels to victory , with the fall of Tripoli in August
