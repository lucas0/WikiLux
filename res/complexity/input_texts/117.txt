Paul the Octopus \( 26 January 2008 26 October 2010 \) was a common octopus used to predict the results of association football matches Accurate predictions in the 2010 World Cup brought him worldwide attention as an animal oracle During divinations , Paul 's keepers would present him with two boxes containing food The boxes were identical except that they were decorated with the different team flags of the competitors in an upcoming football match Whichever box Paul ate from first was considered his prediction for which team would win the match His keepers at the Sea Life Centre in Oberhausen , Germany , mainly tasked him with predicting the outcomes of international matches in which the German national football team was playing Paul correctly chose the winning team in four of Germany 's six Euro 2008 matches , and all seven of their matches in the 2010 World Cup including Germany 's third place play off win over Uruguay on 10 July He also correctly chose Spain as the winner of the 2010 FIFA World Cup final Christenson , Marcus Psychic octopus Paul predicts Spain to beat Holland in World Cup final , The Guardian , 9 July 2010 In all , Paul amassed an overall record of 12 correct predictions out of 14 a success rate of approximately 85 7 Life thumb left Paul in his tank , 2010 Paul was hatched from an egg at the Sea Life Centre in Weymouth , England , and was then moved to a tank at one of the chain 's centres at Oberhausen in Germany Paul 's name derived from the title of a poem by the German children 's writer Boy Lornsen Der Tintenfisch Paul Oktopus Published in Das alte Schwein lebt immer noch Boy Lornsens Tierleben , Schneekluth \( 1985 \) , Republished in and eponymous with the anthology Der Tintenfisch Paul Oktopus Gedichte f r neugierige Kinder , 2009 , Manfred Boje Verlag According to Sea Life 's entertainment director , Daniel Fey , Paul demonstrated intelligence early in life There was something about the way he looked at our visitors when they came close to the tank It was so unusual , so we tried to find out what his special talents were The animal rights organisation PETA commented that octopuses are some of the most intelligent of invertebrates , with complex thought processes , long and short term memories , and different personalities They can use tools , learn through observation , and are particularly sensitive to pain , according to the group They said it would be cruel to keep Paul in permanent confinement Sea Life Centres responded that it would be dangerous to release him , because he was born in captivity , and was not accustomed to finding food for himself Following Paul 's rise to fame , businessmen in Carballi o , a community in Galicia , collected about 30 , 000 for a transfer fee to get Paul as main attraction of the local Fiesta del Pulpo festival bieten 30 000 Euro Abl sesumme f r Pulpo Paul FTD 10 July 2010 Manuel Pazo , a fisherman and head of the local business club assured people that Paul would be presented alive in a tank and not on the menu Sealife rejected the offer nevertheless Kraken Orakel vs Propheten Papagei FR online nach einer DPA Meldung , 8 July 2010 Divination Paul 's career as an oracle began during the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament In the lead up to Germany 's international football matches , Paul was presented with two clear plastic boxes , each containing food a mussel or an oyster Each container was marked with the flag of a team , one the flag of Germany , and the other the flag of Germany 's opponent The box which Paul opened first \( and ate its contents \) was deemed to be the predicted winner of the match There was no method for Paul to pick a draw , despite this being a possible outcome for group stage matches Professor Chris Budd , of the University of Bath , and Professor David Spiegelhalter , of Cambridge University , have both compared Paul 's apparent success to a run of luck when tossing a coin Under the hypothesis that Paul was equally likely to choose the winner or the loser of a match , and neglecting the possibility of a draw , he had a 1 in 2 chance of predicting a single result and a 1 in 64 chance of predicting six in a row This feat would be unlikely to happen by chance alone , but not hugely so Spiegelhalter points out that there are other animals that have attempted but failed to predict the outcome of football matches it is not remarkable that one animal is more successful than the others , and only the successful animals will gain public attention after the fact There was discussion as to whether differences in flags design could have influenced Paul \( despite Octopus vulgaris being almost certainly colour blind \) , or whether he could have been choosing boxes based on differences in their smell Results UEFA Euro 2008 In UEFA Euro 2008 , Paul predicted Germany to win all of their games , a correct prediction in 4 out of 6 cases He failed to predict their defeats by Croatia in

, Argentina , Spain , and Uruguay His prediction that Argentina would lose prompted Argentine chef Nicolas Bedorrou to post an octopus recipe on Facebook Paul correctly predicted the outcome of the semi final , by choosing the food in the box marked with the Spanish flag German supporters drew hope from his incorrect choice for the Germany versus Spain match in the UEFA Euro 2008 but were disappointed The prediction led to German fans calling for Paul to be eaten In response , the Spanish Prime Minister Jos Luis Rodr guez Zapatero offered to send Paul official state protection , and the Industry Minister Miguel Sebastian called for Paul to be given safe haven in Spain Paul the psychic octopus predicts Spain will beat Holland The Daily Telegraph \( London \) , 9 July 2010 Paul 's notoriety attracted criticism from the President of Iran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who accused him of being a symbol of Western decadence and decay Doubts were expressed as to whether it was actually

scheme On 17 June 2014 , during the 2014 FIFA World Cup , Paul was featured in a Google doodle He was represented as in heaven , perched on a billowy bed of clouds and adorned with a halo when animated , he appeared to vacillate in his predictions for the day 's matches Paul was again featured on 13 July in the doodle for the 2014 final In that doodle , clicking on the clouds in the upper
