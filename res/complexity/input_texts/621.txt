Immediately after the peace with Turkey was signed , Suvorov was again transferred to Poland , where he assumed the command of one of the corps and took part in the Battle of Maciejowice , in which he captured the Polish commander in chief Tadeusz Ko ciuszko On November 4 , 1794 , Suvorov 's forces stormed Warsaw and captured Praga , one of its boroughs The massacre of approximately 20 , 000 civilians in Praga broke the spirits of the defenders and soon put an end to the Ko ciuszko Uprising thumb 250px Exiled Suvorov receiving the Emperor 's order to lead the Russian army against Napoleon It is said that the Russian commander sent a report to his sovereign consisting of only three words hurrah from Warsaw , Suvorov The Empress of Russia replied equally briefly Congratulations , Field Marshal Catherine The newly appointed field marshal remained in Poland until 1795 , when he returned to Saint Petersburg But his sovereign and friend Catherine died in 1796 , and her successor Paul dismissed the veteran in disgrace Suvorov 's Italian campaign Suvorov then lived for some years in retirement on his estate of Konchanskoe , near Novgorod He criticised the new military tactics and dress introduced by the emperor , and some of his caustic verse reached the ears of Paul His conduct therefore came under surveillance and his correspondence with his wife , who had remained at Moscow for his marriage relations had not been happy was tampered with On Sundays he tolled the bell for church and sang among the rustics in the village choir On week days he worked among them in a smock frock But in February 1799 the Emperor Paul I of Russia summoned him to take the field again , this time against the French Revolutionary armies in Italy The campaign opened with a series of Suvorov 's victories \( Cassano d'Adda , Trebbia , Novi \) which reduced the French government to desperate straits and drove every French soldier from Italy , save for the handful under Moreau , which maintained a foothold in the Maritime Alps and around Genoa Suvorov himself gained the rank of prince of the House of Savoy from king of Sardinia thumb right 200px Russian troops under Generalissimo Suvorov crossing the Alps in 1799 But the later events of the eventful year went uniformly against the Russians General Korsakov 's force was defeated by Mass na at Z rich Betrayed by the Austrians , the old field marshal , seeking to make his way over the Swiss passes to the Upper Rhine , had to retreat to Vorarlberg , where the army , much shattered and almost destitute of horses and artillery , went into winter quarters When Suvorov battled his way through the snow capped Alps his army was checked but never defeated For this marvel of strategic retreat , unheard of since the time of Hannibal , Suvorov was raised to the unprecedented rank of generalissimo He was officially promised to be given the military triumph in Russia but the court intrigues led the Emperor Paul to cancel the ceremony Early in 1800 Suvorov returned to Saint Petersburg Paul refused to give him an audience , and , worn out and ill , the old veteran died a few days afterwards on 18 May 1800 , at Saint Petersburg Lord Whitworth , the English ambassador , and the poet Derzhavin were the only persons of distinction present at the funeral Suvorov lies buried in the church of the Annunciation in the Alexander Nevsky Monastery , the simple inscription on his grave stating , according to his own direction , Here lies Suvorov But within a year of his death the tsar Alexander I erected a statue to

Arkadievich \( 1804 1882 \) also became a Russian general Assessment thumb right 200px Suvorov monument in the Swiss Alps The Russians long cherished the memory of Suvorov A great captain , viewed from the standpoint of any age of military history , he functions specially as the great captain of the Russian nation , for the character of his leadership responded to the character of the Russian soldier In an age when war had become an act of diplomacy he restored its true significance as an act of force He had a great simplicity of manner , and while on a campaign lived as a private soldier , sleeping on straw and contenting himself with the humblest fare But he had himself passed through all the gradations of military service His gibes procured him many enemies He had all the contempt of a man of ability and action for ignorant favourites and ornamental carpet knights But his drolleries served sometimes to hide , more often to express , a soldierly genius , the effect of which the Russian army did not soon outgrow If the tactics of the Russians in the Russo Japanese War of 1904 1905 reflected too literally some of the maxims of Suvorov s Turkish wars , the spirit of self sacrifice , resolution and indifference to losses there shown formed a precious legacy from those wars Mikhail Ivanovich Dragomirov declared that he based his teaching on Suvorov 's practice , which he held representative of the fundamental truths of war and of the military qualities of the Russian nation The magnificent Suvorov museum of military history was opened in 1904 Apart from St Petersburg , other Suvorov monuments have been erected in Ochakov \( 1907 \) , Sevastopol , Izmail , Tulchin , Kobrin , Ladoga , Kherson , Timanovka , Simferopol , Kaliningrad , Konchanskoe , Rymnik , and in the Swiss Alps On July 29 , 1942 The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR established the Order of Suvorov It was awarded for successful offensive actions against superior enemy forces
