The Kabbalah Centre International is a non profit organizationworldwide located in Los Angeles , California that provides courses on the Zohar and Kabbalistic teachings online as well as through its

has a multi ethnic , international staff of teachers that offers kabbalistic study and guidance to its worldwide student community Traditionally , rabbis believed that the mysteries of Kabbalah were so complex and so easily misunderstood that it could only be taught to devout students \( mostly males \) only after age 40 History thumb upright Kabbalah Centre in New York City in 2008 The Kabbalah Centre was founded in the United States in July 1965 initially as a publishing house called The National Institute for the Research in Kabbalah by Philip Berg \( born Feivel Gruberger \) and Rabbi Levi Isaac Krakovsky It is likely that Berg was encouraged by his Rebbe and former wife 's uncle Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein to established the publishing house to aid the funding of Brandwein 's Yeshiva in Jerusalem Brandwein was the dean of Yeshivah Kol Yehuda \( a precursor of the US Kabbalah Centres \) which was founded in 1922 The uniqueness of Kol Yehuda was that students focused on kabbalistic study The students would also receive a salary to cover their living expenses so they could devote themselves to full time learning , however Brandwein faced difficulty in finding funds for the yeshiva and publishing After Brandwein 's death , and after several years in Israel , Philip Berg and his wife Karen Berg , re established the independent U S Kabbalah Centre in New York City The Kabbalah Centre in Los Angeles was opened in 1984 After the death of Berg , Karen and Michael Berg act as directors and spiritual teachers of the organization The organization is a registered non profit with over fifty branches worldwide , including major ones in Los Angeles , New York City , London and Toronto Teachings Approach The Kabbalah Centre 's approach to teaching is to start students with teachings of Kabbalah that do not make previous knowledge of Hebrew and Jewish texts a prerequisite for understanding Relation to religion According to its views , all widely held spiritual or religious belief systems are merely specific branches of a universal wisdom The effect of this is a resemblance of religions such as Christianity , Judaism , Islam and Buddhism , as well as new age teachings , to Kabbalah In accordance with this belief , the Kabbalah Centre does not present itself as an alternative to any religion in particular , but rather , as a supplement to it The Bible Some biblical passages , such as the Passage of the Red Sea , are understood to be codes to life and unseen universal laws which the Zohar and writings of the Kabbalists throughout history unravel According to Berg The Zohar reveals the dynamic interplay and interconnectedness of our universe and man 's relationship to it The Kabbalah Centre has produced a series of the Books of the Bible with Kabbalistic commentaries to each of the Weekly portion of the Torah Kabbalistic Bible Yehuda Berg , Research Centre of Kabbalah , 2008 , The Light One should primarily be concerned with their relationship with the essence of God , rather than God himself , as he is beyond comprehension The essence of God is referred to in its teachings as Light The Kabbalah Centre and Contemporary

September 03 , 2004 \) What the Kabbalah Centre Actually Teaches The Jewish Daily Forward Klippot Kabbalah Centre teaches the Kabbalistic concept of Klippot The idea is that everyone has a direct and clear connection to the upper metaphysical spiritual world of the Light \( Ein Sof , unbounded God \) , but that this channel is blocked by Klippot , restricting the spiritual energy from entering the physical body It is through study and practice of Kabbalah teachings and Jewish law \( which the Kabbalah Centre says is early rabbinistic construction to aid in practicing Kabbalah without revealing its secrets \) that one removes Klippot , and it is by violence and negative behavior that one adds Klippot Astrology thumb right Zodiac in a 6th century synagogue at Beit Alpha , Israel The Kabbalah Centre has a strong belief in astrology and asserts that astrology has always been part of Judaism Astrology was studied by Jewish scholars throughout the Middle Ages , though it was opposed by more philosophically inclined thinkers such as Maimonides There is a strong belief in the Kabbalah tradition that cosmic forces affect everything , and knowing how to understand them can prove to be valuable to the aspiring Kabbalist Berg , the founder of the Kabbalah Centre , wrote numerous books on astrology during his career Sex In a book written by Yehuda Berg , a former teacher at the center , he recommended that men not masturbate as semen generated without loving , shared intention does not serve its purpose He also wrote that a man should not orgasm before the woman , as it injects selfishness into the act of love making Other thoughts on sex include that a man should not orgasm with the woman positioned above him , as she is then drawing energies into herself from below , instead of above The most Light is derived from sex that occurs just after midnight on Saturday morning Celebrity followers thumbnail right Painting of Madonna Practicing Kabbalah called Madonna and
