Jihad Movement in Palestine \( , Harakat al Jih d al Isl mi fi Filast n \) known in the West as PIJ , is a small Palestinian militant organization BBC Who are Islamic Jihad \? 9 June 2003 Islamic Jihad leader considers his group as an independent , Islamic , and popular movement with Islam as its ideology , grassroots popular action and armed struggle as its means and the liberation of Palestine as its objective http www palestineremembered com al Ramla Zarnuqa Story455 html Palestinian Islamic Jihad also opposes many other Arab governments , whom they see as being insufficiently Islamic and too Western The PIJ 's armed wing , the Al Quds brigades , has claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks in Israel , including suicide bombings Their ability to carry out attacks on Israel has been limited since Israel 's construction of the West Bank barrier and the isolation of the Gaza Strip , although they frequently threaten waves of martyrdom operations The group is responsible for the Qassam rocket barrages at Israeli towns that have killed and injured civilians , and cause widespread hardship in communities in Israel 's south \( see List of Qassam rocket attacks \) The rockets are primarily launched from Hamas controlled Gaza Islamic Jihad is significantly smaller than Hamas , and lacks the wide social network that Hamas has The Palestinian Islamic Jihad was formed in the Gaza Strip during the 1970s by Fathi Shaqaqi and Abd Al Aziz Awda as a branch of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad , an organization currently led by Ramadan Abdullah Mohammad Shallah The group is also said to receive some funding from Hezbollah The group has also clashed repeatedly with Hamas following the latter 's takeover of the Gaza strip in mid 2007 The European Union List of organisations recognized as terrorist groups and six countries , including Israel and the United StatesUS Office of Counterterrorism , call the group a terrorist organization History and Background The Palestinian Islamic Jihad was created after many members of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood found that the organization was becoming too moderate and did not commit enough effort to the Palestinian struggle So therefore in the late 1970s , the founders of the PIJ , Fathi Shaqaqi and Abd al Aziz Awda created the group to fight for the sovereignty of Palestine and the destruction of Israel Shaqaqi and Awda conducted operations out of Egypt until 1981 when group was exiled after the assassination of President Anwar Sadat The PIJ continued its work in Gaza until it was exiled to Lebanon in 1987 While in Lebanon , the group was able to receive training from Hezbollah and ultimately developed a close relationship with the Lebanese organization While in Lebanon , the PIJ adopted the use of suicide bombing and other forms of terrorism as their principle method of achieving their goals In 1989 , the PIJ moved its operation to Damascus where it remains to this day The group is currently based in the Syrian capital , Damascus , but there are also offices in Beirut , Tehran and Khartoum Its financial backing is believed to come from Syria and Iran The group operates primarily in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , but has also carried out attacks in Jordan and Lebanon Its main strongholds in the West Bank are the cities of Hebron and Jenin The PIJ has approximately 50 to 200 members as well as recruiting suicide bombers and volunteers Because of its small size , the PIJ is unable to run large scale training camps so instead they rely heavily on other organizations such as Hezbollah for support Islamic Jihad has much in common with Hamas They both work towards the destruction of Israel as a state as well as restoring the true faith to the Muslim world The distinction between the groups comes in the order of these priorities The Islamic Brotherhood , like many other fundamentalist Islamic movements , sees jihad as a general duty of all Muslims and proposed that first proper Islam should be established throughout the Muslim world Only after the primary goal is achieved , violent jihad should be directed against Israel In contrast , the irredentist Hamas movement switched the two priorities It maintained that first jihad should be directed at liberating all of Palestine , and then Muslims should direct their attention to the goal of restoring the true faith to the rest of the Islamic world Both groups were formed as offshoots of the Muslim Brotherhood and receive a large amount of funding from Iran With similar goals , Hamas and the PIJ have worked together on a number of attacks on Israel including a suicide bombing in Beit Lid in February 1995 that killed eight Israelis and wounded fifty Fathi Shaqaqi led the organization for two decades until his death in in Malta in October 1995 by an unknown party The Palestinian Islamic Jihad often attempts to carry out attacks against Israeli targets on the anniversary of his death , although the identity of the assassins was never determined During the Al Aqsa Intifada , beginning in September 2000 , the PIJ committed many suicide bombing attacks against Israelis Many of the attacks in 2001 and 2002 came from the PIJ in Jenin , headed by Mahmoud Tawallbe , Ali Sefoori and Tabeth Mardawi The headquarters of the PIJ in Jenin and the West Bank was seriously damaged during Operation Defensive Shield Tawallbe was killed by an IDF Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozer while Sefoori and Mardawi were arrested by Israel security forces On February 20 , 2003 , University of South Florida computer engineering professor Dr Sami Al Arian was arrested after being indicted on 50 terrorism related charges US Attorney General John Ashcroft alleged at a press conference that Dr Al Arian is the North American head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad On December 6 , 2005 , Al Arian was acquitted on eight of the 17 charges against him and the jury deadlocked on the rest 10 2 Then on March 2 , 2006 , Al Arian entered a guilty plea to a charge of conspiracy to help members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in nonviolent activities , unrelated to the PIJ Al Arian was sentenced to 57 months less time \( about 38 months \) served , and will be deported upon completion of the remainder of the sentence Islamic Jihad is alleged to have used teens as suicide bombers On March 29 , 2004 , 16 year old Tamer Khuweir in Rifidia , an Arab suburb of Nablus was apprehended by Israeli security forces as he prepared to carry out a suicide attack His older brother claimed he was brainwashed to do it by an Islamic Jihad cleric and demanded the Palestinian Authority investigate the incident and arrest those responsible for it After Shaqaqi 's death , Palestinian Islamic Jihad has been led since 1995 by fellow founder Sheikh Abdullah Ramadan Shallah , aka Ramadan Abdullah Mohammad Shallah , who was then listed as a Specially Designated Terrorist under United States law on November 27 , 1995 , and subsequently was indicted on RICO charges , and consequently became one of the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists on February 24 , 2006 The PIJ s main target is Israel but they also see the United States and Western Secularism as an enemy The PIJ considered the United States an enemy because of its support for Israel The PIJ also opposes moderate Arab governments that it believes have been tainted by Western secularism and has carried out attacks in Jordan , Lebanon and Egypt Israeli response The Israeli response has been to use targeted assassination HaaretzIsrael targets senior Hamas , Islamic

PRESS insignias penetrated the border fence and assaulted a guard tower in what Islamic Jihad and the army said was a failed attempt to capture an Israeli soldier Press slams gunmen for using TV jeep Jerusalem Post IDF troops killed one militant , while the others escaped The use of a vehicle that resembled a press vehicle evoked a sharp response from many journalists and news organizations The Middle East director for Human Rights Watch , Sarah Leah Whitsonn , responded by saying , Using a vehicle with press markings to carry out a military attack is a serious violation of the laws of war , and it also puts journalists at risk Gaza Armed Palestinian Groups Commit Grave Crimes \( Human Rights Watch , 13 6 2007 \) The FPA responded by saying , Armored vehicles marked with TV are an invaluable protection for genuine journalists working in hostile environments The FPA has long campaigned for the continued availability of armored vehicles for its members , despite official opposition in some quarters The abuse of this recognized protection for the working journalist is a grave development and we condemn those that carried it out Such an incident will reduce the protection offered by marked vehicles During a press conference , an Islamic Jihad spokesperson Abu Ahmed denied that they had put press markings on the jeep used in the attack and said , The Al Quds Brigades used an armoured jeep resembling military armoured jeeps used by the Zionist intelligence services Journalists slam use of 'press vehicle' by Gaza militants On March 26 , 2009 , two Islamic
