Multan to Allahabad Shaikh Ismail used to live mainly at Multan looking after the propogation and educative activities of his Khanqaah until the death of his elder brother Shah Ruknuddin who passed away in 1334 AD Before the death of his brother he had a divine intuition to move to Allahabad which was called Prayag at that time , at this istance he travelled first to Delhi where the emperor Allauddin Khilji and his successor welcomed him From there he travelled to Allahabad via kara and settled in a village named Bamhrauli or Bamrauli \( Chail , Allahabad \) Thus he is considered to be one of the earliest Shaikhs who settled in the environs of the present city of Allahabad He started calling the people to the way of salvation , i e Islam and at his hands a lot of Hindu tribes embraced Islam Adherence to Shariah Shaikh Ismail strictly adhered to the basic tenets of Islam and did not like anything outside Shariah He did not approve of singing , dancing in the name of Sam'a He exhorted all to live a live of piety respecting their parents and fulfilling the duty of their creation by carrying out the responsibilities as the slave and viceregent of Allah He loved the people irrespective of their caste , creed and religion People loved him and thronged to visit , see and consult him He erected a mosque over a small mound exactly on the banks of river ganges and it is where he was laid down to rest after his departure from this world To this day the mosque stands as it is erected by the Shaikh with he himself resting there After living more than 50 years in that area and commanding respect and honour from all he passed away silently in 1349 AH He was bestowed with the honorific title as Makhdoom e Hind Since centures all the great saints of Allahabad and environs have paid their obeisance to his great personality No big dome was erected as per his wish and no Urs rituals are performed at his grave in accordance with the instructions of Shariah \( See Manba al Ansaab Chapter II By Sayyid Muin al Haqq Jhoonsvi Manuscript British Library India Office Collections , London \) The writer of Mirat al Asrar visited him mosque and tomb in the reign of Shahjahan and commented that it is a great place of barkat He lived a simple life and never allowed his name and works to be highlighted in books and discourses , so is the case that except a very few people , not all know about him even in Allahabad Disciples Students from all areas including Kara , Manikpur , Zafarabad , Jaunpur , Jhunsi , Awadh , thronged to be his student Though a lot of students were his disciples but he authroized only three students with Khailafat , One Shaikh Abdul Rahim , Second Shaikh Ali , and third Sayyid Muhammad alias Shah Karak who eventually became his most famous disciple and became known as Shah Karak Majzoob \( Abdal \) of Kara Manikpur , Allahabad who is resting at Kara and is the most famous saint of Allahabad to this day The fact is that he is more known than his master and mentor \( Asral al Makhdumein by Shaikh Karim Yar , published 1893 Fatehpur \) References Allahabd A Gazetteer by C H Nevill , 1911 , Govt Press , United Provinces
