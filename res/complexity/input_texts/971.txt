Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant \( or Koodankulam NPP or KKNPP \) is the largest nuclear power station in India , situated in Koodankulam in the Tirunelveli district of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu Construction on the plant began on 31 March 2002 , but faced several delays due to opposition from local fishermen KKNPP is scheduled to have six VVER 1000 reactors built in collaboration with Atomstroyexport , the Russian state company and Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited \( NPCIL \) , with an installed capacity of 6 , 000 MW of electricity Unit 1 was synchronised with the southern power grid on 22 October 2013 and since then , has been generating electricity at its warranted limit of 1 , 000 MW The original cost of the two units was 13 , 171 crore , but it was later revised to 17 , 270 crore \( US 2 6 billion \) Russia advanced a credit of 6 , 416 crore \( US 0 97 billion \) for both the units Unit 2 attained criticality on 10 July 2016 and was synchronised with the electricity grid on 29 August In 2015 , Nuclear Power Corporation Ltd \( NPCIL \) announced a price of 4 29 kW h \( 6 4 kW h \) for energy delivered from Kudankulam nuclear power plant The ground breaking ceremony for construction of units 3 4 was performed on 17 February 2016 Due to operators and suppliers requirement to insure the next two units at , the cost of units 3 4 amounted to twice the cost of units 1 2 History Background left thumb Kudankulum under construction , 14 April 2009 An Inter Governmental Agreement \( IGA \) on the project was signed on 20 November 1988 by the Prime Minister of India , Rajiv Gandhi and the Soviet head of state , Mikhail Gorbachev , for the construction of two reactors The project remained in limbo for a decade due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union There were also objections from the United States , on the grounds that the agreement did not meet the 1992 terms of the Nuclear Suppliers Group \( NSG \) Nuclear Exports to India from Russia M R Srinivasan , Atomic Energy Commission \( AEC \) Chairman from 1987 to 1990 , called the project a non starter However , the project was revived on 21 June 1998 Construction Construction began on 31 March 2002 , with Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd \( NPCIL \) predicting that the first unit would be operational in March 2007 , instead of the original target of December 2007 A small port became operational in Kudankulam on 14 January 2004 This port was established to receive barges carrying over sized light water reactor equipment from ships anchored at a distance of Until 2004 , materials had to be brought in via road from the port of Thoothukudi , risking damage during transportation In 2008 , negotiations on building four additional reactors at the site began Though the capacity of these reactors has not been declared , it was expected that the capacity of each reactor will be 1 , 200 MW \( 1 2 GW \) The new reactors would bring the total capacity of the power plant to 6 , 800 MW \( 6 8 GW \) The ground breaking ceremony for construction of third and fourth units was performed on 17 February 2016 Construction of the third unit started on 29 June 2017 Construction of units 5 and 6 is expected to begin in 2020 Cyber attack Malware associated with the Lazarus Group was used to collect technical information from KNPP in 2019 Officials stated that the facility is safe from cyber attacks by virtue of being air gapped On 30 October the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited officially acknowledged the cyber attack and confirmed that the prevalence of malware in NPCIL system is correct Design and specification The reactors are pressurised water reactor of Russian design , model VVER 1000 V 412 referred also as AES 92 Thermal capacity is 3 , 000 MW , gross electrical capacity is 1 , 000 MW with a net capacity of 917 MW Construction is by NPCIL and Atomstroyexport When completed the plant will become the largest nuclear power generation complex in India producing a cumulative 2 GW of electric power Both units are water cooled , water moderated power reactors History of the Kudankulam Project Four more reactors are set to be added to this plant under a memorandum of intent signed in 2008 A firm agreement on setting up two more reactors was postponed Operations The first reactor of the plant attained criticality on 13 July 2013 and was connected to the grid three months later Kudankulam nuclear plant begins power generation Mumbai Mirror \( 2013 10 22 \) Retrieved on 2013 12 06 It started commercial operation from 31 December 2014 The second unit achieved criticality on 10 July 2016 and was connected to the grid in August Commercial operation started on 15 October 2016 The Kerala State Electricity Board \( KSEB \) board members have approved signing of a power purchase agreement \( PPA \) with the Nuclear Power Corporation of India \( NPCIL \) for sourcing electricity from the Kudankulam nuclear power project \( KKNPP \) Unit 1 was shut down in June 2015 for refuelling and annual maintenance On 21 January 2016 the reactor restarted and was connected to grid on 30 January 2016 Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project Site Director D S Choudhary stated on 26 January 2018 that units 1 and 2 of the nuclear plant had generated a combined total of 22 , 800 million units since they began functioning Opposition In 2011 , thousands from the vicinity of the plant protested against it , fearing a nuclear disaster , in the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster According to the protesters , evacuation of people in the event of a nuclear disaster would be impossible According to S P Udayakumar , of the People 's Movement Against Nuclear Energy , the nuclear plant is unsafe However , in 2012 , the chief of India 's nuclear energy programme , Dr Srikumar Banerjee , called the plant one of the safest in the world In December 2012 , The Hindu reported that hundreds of villagers in the region were largely ignorant of the risks and benefits of the plant A Public Interest Litigation \( PIL \) was filed in 2011 with the Supreme Court asking for nuclear power development to be delayed until safety concerns were independently assessed In May 2013 , the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the plant , stating that the nuclear power plant was in the larger public interest In March 2012 , nearly 200 anti nuclear protesters were detained for a few hours by the police The protesters were set to join protests objecting resumption of work of one of two 1 GW reactors , a day after the local government restarted work on the project There have also been rallies and protests in favour of commissioning this nuclear power plant On , 24 February 2012 , Prime Minister Manmohan Singh blamed foreign NGOs for protests at the power plant News agencies reported that three NGOs had diverted donations earmarked for religious and social causes to the protests , in violation of foreign exchange regulations Supporters of the power plant in Idinthakarai village have been targeted by opponents using improvised explosive devices Role of Church The Church of South India and the National Council of Churches opposed the power plant and supported the protests against it Supporters of the power plant and the government have alleged that the protest against the power plant was instigated by churches and funded by foreign sources The protestors dismissed the allegation of foreign funding , but said that seeking support from church was natural as many protestors were Christian Response from officials Former chairman of Atomic Energy Commission of India Srinivasan said , The Fukushima plant was built on a beach front , but the Kudankulam was constructed on a solid terrain and that too keeping all the safety aspects in mind Also , we are not in a tsunami prone area The plants in Kudankulam have a double containment system which can withstand high pressure At least 14 , 000 crore has been spent If we do n't operate the plant immediately , it will affect the economic stability of our country A centre panel constituted by the Government of India , which did a survey of the safety features in the plant , vouched for the safety of the Kudankulam reactors Dr Muthunayagam , who headed the panel , said that the protesters asked for some documents which are not related to the safety of the reactor Nuclear scientist and principal scientific adviser to the federal Government of India Rajagopala Chidambaram has said We have learnt lessons from the Fukushima nuclear accident , particularly on the post shut down cooling system , and also added Fukushima nuclear accident should not deter or inhibit India from pursuing a safe civil nuclear programme The Tamil Nadu state government formed a four member expert panel which submitted a report to the government after inspecting the safety features of the plant The Tamil Nadu government in the wake of the acute power shortages in the state has ordered in favour of the commissioning of the plant Allocation of power Government of India announced the power allocation from the two units of the reactor on 29 August 2013 Press Information Bureau
