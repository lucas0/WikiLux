Formal democracy is a state system that has in place superficial forms of democracy but is not actually managed democratically The former Soviet Union has been retroactively characterized in this fashion since its constitution was essentially democratic , while the state was managed by the bureaucratic lite known as the Politburo But the concept was originally introduced in the 1988 book Manufacturing Consent by Edward S Herman and Noam Chomsky to describe one effect of USA foreign policy and Nation building techniques which created market client states for neo liberal capitalism States identified by Herman Chomsky as formal democracies include pre revolutionary Iran , Nicaragua under Somoza and the Philippines under Marcos The United States , especially from 1980 on under Ronald W Reagan , is also said to fit the description , as all levers of government were effectively controlled and often directly staffed by members of the plutocracy The visible manifestations of this mode of government seemed to have peaked during the administration of George W Bush , who went so far as to seek to undermine the US Constitution itself , but government by manipulated consent is a problem afflicting the entire US political system , regardless of party affiliation , and is likely to continue until extensive radical reforms are implemented to overhaul or bypass the business controlled mass communications system , inaugurate proportional representation , root out corporate lobbying and overwhelming corporate influence on all sectors of national policy , and embrace other measures designed to make the satisfaction of the well informed ordinary citizen 's interest the chief object of political activity In the acquisition of this ambitious goal , the corporate media remain a significant hurdle In terms of actual policy objectives and most notably key personnel , the new administration of Pres Barack Obama , despite a campaign anchored in the promise of serious change , does not seem to have deviated much , except in cosmetic aspects , from its predecessors See also Substantive democracy Procedural democracy External links Article on Noam Chomsky Neoliberalism by Robert McChesney Category Government
