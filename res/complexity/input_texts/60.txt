19th century , another metropolitan bishop , Eugene Bolkhovitinov , had the site excavated Under his administration , a new church of the Tithes was built in stone \( between 1828 and 1842 \) Michael

church was destroyed by the Soviet authorities Plans for reconstruction A plan to rebuild the church is under consideration in Kiev Proponents of reconstruction point out the historical and political importance of rebuilding a church so significant in Eastern Slavic history Opponents refer to the lack of any documentary descriptions or depictions of the original church , and that excavations were unable to determine even the layout of its foundation Besides , the monumental building of the new church is likely to be in disharmony with the delicate 18th century St Andrew 's Church , one of the most famous landmarks of Kiev , located adjacent to the original location of the destroyed Church of the Tithes Its reconstruction would also require the destruction of the city 's oldest tree , a 370 year old linden On 3 February 2005 , the President of Ukraine , Viktor Yushchenko , signed a decree on the restoration of the Tithe Church , to which the state budget provides nearly 90 million
