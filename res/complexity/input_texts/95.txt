operating system or mobile operating system software providing a platform for application developers Smart TV platforms or middleware have a public Software development kit \( SDK \) and or Native development kit \( NDK \) for apps so that third party developers can develop applications for it , and an app store so that the end users can install and uninstall apps themselves The public SDK

that a smart TV is vulnerable to attacks Some serious security bugs have been discovered , and some successful attempts to run malicious code to get unauthorized access were documented on video There is evidence that it is possible to gain root access to the device , install malicious software , access and modify configuration information for a remote control , remotely access and modify files on TV and attached USB drives , access camera and microphone There have also been concerns that hackers may be able to remotely turn on the microphone or web camera on a smart TV , being able to eavesdrop on private conversations A common loop antenna may be set for a bidirectional transmission channel , capable of uploading data rather than only receiving Since 2012 , security researchers discovered a similar vulnerability present in more series of Smart Tvs , which allows hackers to get an external root access on the device Anticipating growing demand for an antivirus for a smart TV , some security software companies are already working with partners in digital TV field on the solution At this writing it seems like there is only one antivirus for smart TVs available 'Neptune' , a cloud based antimalware system developed by Ocean Blue Software in partnership with Sophos However , antivirus company Avira has joined forces with digital TV testing company Labwise to work on software to protect against potential attacks The privacy policy for Samsung 's Smart TVs has been called Orwellian \( a reference to George Orwell and the dystopian world of constant surveillance he depicted in 1984 \) , and compared to Telescreens because of eavesdropping concerns Not in front of the telly Warning over 'listening' TV BBC News , 2015 Hackers have misused Smart TV 's abilities
