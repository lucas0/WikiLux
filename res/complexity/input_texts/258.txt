thumb A sculpture believed to show Gorgo Gorgo \( fl 480 BC \) was a Queen of Sparta She was the daughter and the only known child of Cleomenes I , King of Sparta \( r 520 490 BC \) during the 6th and 5th centuries BC She was the wife of King Leonidas I , Cleomenes' half brother , who fought and died in the Battle of Thermopylae Gorgo is noted as one of the few female historical figures actually named by Herodotus , and was known for her political judgement and wisdom She is notable for being the daughter of a king of Sparta , the wife of another , and the mother of a third Her birth date is uncertain , but is most likely to have been between 518 and 508 BC , based on Herodotus' dating \( Histories 5 51 \) Family background Her father Cleomenes was the eldest born son of the previous Agiad king , Anaxandridas II , and succeeded his father at his death however , he had three paternal half brothers , of whom the eldest , Dorieus , would cause him some trouble The other two half brothers were Leonidas I and Cleombrotus All four were sons of Anaxandridas II , one of the dual kings of Sparta of the Agiad house According to one version \( Herodotus 's Histories , 5 4 \) , Gorgo 's grandfather Anaxandridas II was long married without children , and was advised to remarry \( i e take a second wife \) which he did His second wife gave birth to the future Cleomenes I who was thus his eldest son however , his first wife also became pregnant , and eventually had three sons , including Leonidas I This version is however not supported by other sources , which imply that Cleomenes was either born by the king 's first marriage or by a non marital alliance Most historians favor Herodotus because he is the earliest source In either case , there appears to have been some tension between the eldest son and his half brothers , resolved only by the former 's death \( or murder \) and the accession of Leonidas I \( at once his half brother and his son in law \) According to Herodotus 's Histories , at about the age of eight to nine years old , she advised her father Cleomenes not to trust Aristagoras of Miletus , a foreign diplomat trying to induce Cleomenes to support an Ionian revolt against Persians Father , you had better have this man go away , or the stranger will corrupt you Cleomenes followed her advice Marriage and reign Looking forward to Cleomenes' death , his only surviving child Gorgo became his sole heiress She was apparently already married by 490 to her half uncle Leonidas I King Leonidas and Queen Gorgo would have at least one child , a son , Pleistarchus , co King of Sparta from 480 BC to his death in 459 BC 458 BC Arguably , Gorgo 's most significant role occurred prior to the Persian invasion of 480 BC According to Herodotus 's Histories , Demaratus , then in exile at the Persian court , sent a warning to Sparta about Xerxes 's pending invasion In order to prevent the message from being intercepted by the Persians or their vassal states , the message was written on a wooden tablet and then covered with wax The Spartans , presumably the ephors , Gerousia or the kings , did not know what to do with the seemingly blank wax tablet , until Queen Gorgo advised them to clear the wax off the tablet She is described by David Kahn in his book The Codebreakers as one of the first female cryptanalysts whose name has been recorded According to Plutarch , before the Battle of Thermopylae , knowing that her husband 's death in battle was inevitable , she asked him what to do Leonidas replied marry a good man who will treat you well , bear him children , and live a good life Children She had at least one son by Leonidas I , Pleistarchus , co King of Sparta from 480 BC to his death in 458 BC Her son was a minor at his father 's death , so his uncle Cleombrotus \( died 480 BC \) and then his first cousin and heir Pausanias \( r 480 479 BC \) acted as his regent It was Pausanias who was the architect of the combined Greek victory at the Battle of Plataea \( 479 BC \) See Herodotus The Histories Book 9 \( all \) , and Thucydides History of the Peloponnesian War I 126 139 After Pausanias fell into disfavor and was accused of plotting treason , Leonidas 's son Pleistarchus ruled with the other king of Sparta , Leotychidas II \( and then his grandson Archidamus \) until his death 459 458 BC Historical mentions There are sections where she is present at court or in council and gives advice to the king or the elders This indicates either that Gorgo was highly thought of by Herodotus , who often left out the names of the female figures he included in his books , or that as the wife of Leonidas I , her actions and counsel were all the more noteworthy Plutarch quotes Queen Gorgo as follows When asked by a woman from Attica , 'Why are you Spartan women the only ones who can rule men \? ' , she said 'Because we are also the only ones who give birth to men ' Another version has this as , some foreign lady , as it would seem , told her that the women of Lacedaemon were the only women in the world who could rule men 'With good reason , ' she said , 'for we are the only women who bring forth men ' \( Plutarch 's Lives Lycurgus \) In popular culture Queen Gorgo was portrayed by Greek actress and future politician Anna Synodinou in the 1962 film The 300 Spartans Gorgo appears as a major character in Sacred Games , by Gary Corby The character makes a minor appearance in the 1998 comic series 300 by Frank Miller , who was heavily inspired by the aforementioned film In the 2006 motion picture adaptation of the comic , 300 , English actress Lena Headey plays Gorgo In this version , her more important role in the events preceding and during the war with Persia is shown as she is politically more involved Headey reprised her role in the 2014 sequel , 300 Rise of an Empire Helena P Schrader has published the first book in a three part biographical novel on Leonidas and Gorgo The first book , Leonidas of Sparta A Boy of the Agoge , focuses on Leonidas 's boyhood in the notorious Spartan agoge , but books two and three will give prominence to Gorgo too Gorgo is one of the two leaders of Greece in the strategic video game Civilization VI Official Sid Meier 's youtube channel video of Gorgo https www youtube com watch \? v syS SFtr 44 Official Sid Meier 's youtube channel video of Pericles https www youtube com watch \? v VSCTlpEM9Vw Notes References Sources A Profile of Gorgo from a website Herodotus 's Histories Book VII Polymnia where Gorgo is mentioned in Section 239 \( 7 239 \) advising the Spartan elders after Thermopylae For a number of essays on Leonidas and Gorgo visit Helena Schrader 's website Sparta Leonidas Gorgo Further reading Blundell , Sue Women in Ancient Greece British Museum Press , London , 1995 Sealey , Raphael Women and Law in Classical Greece University of North Carolina Press , Chapel Hill London , 1990 Pomeroy , Sarah Spartan Women Oxford University Press , 2002 Schrader , Helena P , ' Scandalous Spartan Women , ' Sparta Reconsidered , Schrader , Helena P , Scenes from a Spartan Marriage , Sparta Journal of Ancient Spartan and Greek History , Vol 6 , 1 Schrader , Helena P , The Bride of Leonidas , the Leonidas Trilogy , Schrader , Helena P , Leonidas of Sparta A Peerless Peer Wheatmark , Tucson , 2011 Category Battle of Thermopylae Category Spartan princesses Category 5th century BC Spartans Category 5th century BC Greek women Category Spartans of the Greco Persian Wars Category 6th century BC births Category Year of birth uncertain Category Year of death unknown Category Ancient Spartan queens consort Category Agiad dynasty Category Leonidas I
