See Themselves and Why It Matters \( 2010 \) is a discussion of North Korean propaganda , contending that North Korea under Kim Jong il was guided by a paranoid , race based nationalism with roots in Japanese fascism Book Discussion with Author B R Myers North Korea International Documentation Project Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars \( Accessed February 1 , 2010 \) Myers asserts that the North Korean political system is not based on communism or Stalinism , and he contends that the official Juche idea is a sham ideology for foreign consumption and intended to establish Kim Il sung 's credentials as a thinker alongside Mao Zedong Myers also claims that post Cold War attempts to understand North Korea as a Confucian patriarchy , based on the filial piety of Kim Jong il and the dynastic transfer of power from his father , are misguided and that the North Korean leadership is maternalist rather than paternalist Myers furthers his argument about the status of Juche as a non ideology in his book North Korea 's Juche Myth \( 2015 \) According to his own account , promoting him to write the book was the realization he was making not the slightest bit of headway with The Cleanest Race in challenging the conventional wisdom about Juche in the academia North Korea 's Juche Myth develops a three pronged categorization of North Korean propaganda Some works are in the inner track , meant for North Korean eyes only Others are in the outer track , meant primarily for North Korean consumption but mindful of the fact that foreigners can access them too Export track propaganda specifically targets foreigners Reception and criticism Myers book The Cleanest Race has been challenged by several academic critics Charles K Armstrong , Trends in the Study of North Korea

, p 360 Felix Abt , a Swiss business affairs specialist who lived in North Korea for seven years , describes Myers' claims in The Cleanest Race as flawed and shaky Abt wrote that it was rather absurd
