The Serb Catholic movement in Dubrovnik \( \) was a pan Serb cultural and political organization in Dubrovnik active at various periods between the 1830s and the interwar period while Dubrovnik was part of the Habsburg ruled Kingdom of Dalmatia The group of local Catholic intellectuals , known as Serb Catholics \( Srbi katolici \) or Catholic Serbs \( katoli ki Srbi \) , espoused strong pro Serbian sentiments The most prominent incarnations of the movement were the early pan Slavic phase under Matija Ban and Medo Puci , and more Serbian nationalists phase active between the 1880s and 1908 , led by a large number of Dubrovnik intellectuals at the time Background Before the 19th century , it is difficult to ascertain the precise number of residents in Dubrovnik who self identified as Serbs Prior to the twentieth century , Dubrovnik had never been ruled over by a Slavic nation , although it did have close trade and political ties with medieval Serbian states In the early Middle Ages , Dubrovnik lay at a crossroads between the Balkan regions inhabited by the Croat and Serb tribes Most sources from the later medieval and early modern period simply refer to Dubrovnik 's Slavic inhabitants generically as Slav and their language as Slavic With the increased emphasis on ethnic distinction in the nineteenth century , there are increased references to Serbs and Croats as distinct peoples of Dubrovnik The Republic of Ragusa enforced a single state religion of Roman Catholicism , while Orthodoxy was given equal status with Catholicism only in 1848 , by which time there were hundreds of Orthodox immigrants from Herzegovina in the city who maintained their religious affiliation with the Serbian Orthodox Church The Eparch of Dalmatia Josif Raja i dispatched the first Orthodox priest to Dubrovnik , or e Nikolajevi , in 1833 History The cultural and political movement of Serbs in Dubrovnik was started around this time , notably by Nikolajevi 's 1838 article in the newspaper Srbsko Dalmatinski Magazin \( published in Zadar by Bo idar Petranovi \) , where he claimed the entire Ragusan Slavonic literary corpus for Serbian literature In 1841 , Medo Puci , a writer from an old Catholic noble family , became acquainted with pan Slavists J n Koll r and Pavel Jozef af rik , and started to espouse a Serb national sentiment Matija Ban , another Catholic from Dubrovnik , was influenced by pan Slavists and romantic nationalists Micha Czajkowski and Franti ek Zach in Istanbul , so much that he moved to Belgrade in 1844 in an attempt to promote his idea that Serbian patriotism must extend beyond Serbian Orthodoxy and the borders of the Principality of Serbia In Serbia , Ban 's group of enthusiasts worked with Serbia 's minister of the interior Ilija Gara anin , the author of Na ertanije , to enter the upper reaches of Serbian political life They were not , however , met with uniform acceptance Jovan Sterija Popovi and others , with support of the Church in Serbia , protested against their ideas and by extension against Vuk Karad i 's notion that Serbian language and nationality extended beyond Orthodoxy thumb Serb sports society Du an the Mighty , Dubrovnik , 1910 During the Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas \( 1848 1849 \) , the Serbian government was involved on the side of the South Slavs in Serbian Vojvodina , and at the same time Matija Ban traveled to Croatian lands and advocated for pan Slavic as well as pro Serbian ideas , claiming the Kingdom of Dalmatia should be unified with the Kingdom of Croatia Slavonia , but also describing the language of Dubrovnik as Serbian By 1850 , the revolution was over and Ban , particularly because he had acquired Serbian citizenship in 1844 , became suspicious to the Austrian police in Dubrovnik , who started to monitor him At that point , he was summoned to Belgrade where Gara anin suspended all of his operations and ordered him to permanently return to Belgrade He hesitated , but was persuaded by Prince Aleksandar and others to comply He did however leave his family in Dubrovnik and published two more issues of the journal Dubrovnik in Ljudevit Gaj 's publishing house in Zagreb in 1851 and 1852 Three decades later , in the 1880s a sizable group of Ragusan intellectuals independently developed a Serb Catholic feeling , but at that point it was a political movement that was openly hostile to the Croats and whose leaders cooperated with the pro Italian Autonomist Party \( i e it was not pan Slavic \) Following the 1878 Congress of Berlin , the Habsburg Empire occupied Bosnia and created the Austro Hungarian Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina , which prompted a confrontation between the Serb and Croat national ideologies , and the new Serb Catholic circle of Dubrovnik increasingly broke with the pan Slavic tradition of its founders , Puci and Ban The same year , Serbia obtained independence In the preparation for the Imperial Council election of 1879 , the Serb Party of Dalmatia severed ties with the People 's Party , which marked a significant shift in Dalmatian politics at the time Subsequently , in 1890 , a coalition of the Autonomist Party and the Serb Party won the municipal election in Dubrovnik , where the Autonomists were considered to be Serb Catholics In the elections of 1899 , local Croats saw their big mistake and a coalition of the People 's Croatian Party \( from 1899 new name of the People 's Party in Dalmatia \) and the Party of Rights came into power thumb Literature of Dubrovnik , published by the Serb Academic Youth of Dubrovnik \( 1900 \) In 1904 1905 , a cultural society Croatian and Serbian People 's Home from Cavtat \( south of Dubrovnik \) promulgated pan Slavic ideas Narodna zastava

authorities , which led to massive emigration of Serbian oriented high society from the city of Dubrovnik Matica Srpska of Dubrovnik was founded in 1909 by the last will of Serbian businessman Konstantin Vu kovi Legacy After World War I , in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia those Serbs who were left in Dubrovnik opted for the Yugoslav national unity , in contrast to Croats in the city who opted for the preserving of autonomous status of Croatia in Yugoslavia and unification of Dalmatia with Croatia Slavonia In 1939 Dubrovnik with its district became part of Banovina of Croatia which was established the same year Those circumstances intensified emigration During the Independent State of Croatia \( 1941 1945 \) , the city completely reoriented itself to Croatian culture In recent times , the prominence of the 19th century Serb Catholic movement in Dubrovnik was misused by proponents of the idea of Greater Serbia Today , Serbs in Dubrovnik make up 2 73 of the town 's population
