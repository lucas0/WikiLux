c 1658 \) , National Gallery of London Article VI of the Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England lists it as a book of the Apocrypha Protestants regard Tobit as apocryphal because it was not included in the Tanakh nor considered canonical by Judaism In Judaism Before the 1952 discovery of Aramaic and Hebrew fragments of Tobit among the Dead Sea Scrolls in a cave at Qumran , scholars believed Tobit was not included in the Jewish canon because of late authorship , estimated to 100 AD Fitzmyer , at p 50 , 55 57 Qumran fragments of the text , which were copied between 100 BC to 25 AD , evidence a much earlier origin than previously thought These fragments evidence authorship no later than the 2nd century BC and , likely , contemporary with the date ascribed , by modern scholars , to the final compilation of the Book of Daniel , which did attain canonical status R Glenn Wooden , Changing Perceptions of Daniel Reading Chapters 4 and 5 of Daniel , in From Biblical Criticism to Biblical Faith , Brackney Evans eds , p 10 \( Mercer Univ Press 2007 \) Other scholars have postulated that Tobit was excluded from the Jewish Scriptures for a halakhic reason because Raguel , the bride 's father , wrote the marriage document discussed in , instead of the bridegroom , as required by Jewish rabbinical law However , some ancient Jewish rabbinic scholars possibly considered Tobit to be canonical Midrash Bereishit Rabbah , an aggadic commentary on the Book of Genesis compiled circa 400 600 AD , includes a truncated Aramaic version of Tobit Tobit was also part of the Septuagint , the first Greek translation of the Bible \) In more contemporary times , a number of Jews in Israel have sought to reclaim Tobit as part of the canon Mark Bredin , Studies in the Book of Tobit A

calves that Jeroboam , king of the northern kingdom of Israel , set up at Dan He is particularly noted for his diligence in attempting to provide proper burials for fallen Israelites whom Sargon 's successor , Sennacherib , has slain For this behavior the king seizes his property and exiles him After Sennacherib 's death , Tobit is allowed to return to Nineveh , where he buries a man who has been murdered on the street That night , he sleeps in the open and is blinded by bird droppings which fall into his eyes The blindness caused by this injury strains his marriage and , ultimately , he prays for death Tobit , book of , Jewish Encyclopedia Meanwhile , in faraway Media , a young woman named Sarah has prayed for death in despair The demon of lust , Asmodeus \( the worst of demons \) , abducts and kills every man Sarah marries on their wedding night before the marriage can be consummated God sends the angel Raphael , disguised as a human , to heal Tobit and free Sarah from the demon The main narrative is dedicated to Tobit 's son , Tobiah or Tobiyah \( Greek Tobias \) , who is sent by his father to collect money that the elder has deposited in distant Media Raphael presents himself as Tobit 's kinsman , Azariah , and offers to aid and protect Tobias Under Raphael 's guidance , Tobias journeys to Media with his dog Along the way , while washing his feet in the river Tigris , a fish tries to swallow his foot By the angel 's order , he captures it and removes its heart , liver and gall bladder thumb right Tobias and Sara Sleep , 1860 woodcut by Julius Schnorr von

burn the fish 's liver and heart to drive away the demon when he attacks on the wedding night The two marry , and the fumes of the burning organs drive the demon to Upper Egypt , where Raphael follows and binds him Sarah 's father had been digging a grave to secretly bury Tobias under the assumption that he would be killed Surprised to find his son in law alive and well , he orders a double length wedding feast and has the grave secretly filled Since the feast prevents him from leaving , Tobias sends Raphael to recover his father 's money After the feast , Tobias and Sarah return to Nineveh There , Raphael tells the youth to use the fish 's gall to cure his father 's blindness Raphael then reveals his identity and returns to heaven , and Tobit sings a hymn of praise Tobit tells his son to leave Nineveh before God destroys it according to prophecy \( compare the Book of Nahum \) After the prayer , Tobit dies at an advanced age Tobit 's age at death is variously given as 127 years in

a book considered canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church http torahofyeshuah blogspot com 2015 07 book of meqabyan i iii html Composition Dating thumb Tobias heals the blindness of his father Tobit , by Domingos Sequeira The story in the Book of Tobit is set in the 8th century BC Miller , at p 10 However , a number of historical errors \( according to Miller , though some may dispute this \) rule out contemporaneous authorship , Miller , at p 11 and most scholars now date the book 's composition between 225 and 175 BC Fitzmyer , at p 51 The direct quote in Tobit 2 6 from the Book of Amos \( Your feasts shall be turned into mourning , and all your mirth into lamentation \) indicates that the prophetic books had become not only fixed but authoritative , signalling a post exilic date Moreover , reference to the Book of Moses \( 6 13 , 7 11 13 \) and the Law of Moses \( 7 13 \) echo identical phrasing in the Book of Chronicles , which some believe was composed after the 4th century BC Fitzmyer , at p 51 Miller , at p 11 Contextually , dating Tobit 's authorship to after 175 BC is problematic , as the author expresses no awareness of Seleucid attempts to Hellenize Judea \( from 175 BC \) or of the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucids \( 165 BC \) , nor does it espouse apocalyptic or messianic expectations upon which later writings focused Fitzmyer , at pp 51 52 Miller at pp 11 12 Nevertheless , some scholars espouse a later date of composition of at least portions of Tobit Fitzmyer , at p 52 Location and language No scholarly consensus exists on the place of composition , and almost every region of the ancient world seems to be a candidate Miller , at pp 12 13 A Mesopotamian origin seems logical given that the story takes place in Assyria and Persia , as does the invocation of the Persian demon aeshma daeva , rendered Asmodeus by Tobit But significant errors in geographical detail \( such as the distance from Ecbatana to Rhages and their topography \) render this origin questionable Miller , at p 13 Arguments against and in favor of Judean or Egyptian composition also exist Miller , at pp 12 15 The original language of composition remains unclear Tobit may have been originally composed either in Aramaic or Hebrew , since fragments of Tobit in both languages have been discovered at Qumran Genre The book is closely related to Jewish wisdom literature This is especially clear in Tobit 's instructions to Tobias before his departure for Media in Chapter 4 , which particularly praise the value of prayer , fasting , and almsgiving Manuscripts thumb Leaf from a vellum manuscript , c 1240 As stated , fragments of Tobit in both Aramaic and Hebrew have been discovered at Qumran Four Aramaic fragmentary texts of Tobit \( 4QToba dar 4Q196 199 \) and one Hebrew text \( 4QTobe 4Q200 \) were found at Qumran in Cave IV A A Di Lella , New English Translation of the Septuagint , Tobit \( PDF \) , 2007 Jerome described his version for the Vulgate as being made from an Aramaic text available to him Surviving Greek translations are found in two versions The shorter , which Robert Hanhart called Greek I in his edition of the Septuagint , is found in Codex Vaticanus , Alexandrinus , Venetus , and most cursive manuscripts The Greek II version , 1700 words longer , is found in Codex Sinaiticus and closely aligns with the Hebrew and Aramaic fragments found at Qumran Apparently the Old Latin \( La \) manuscripts are also translated from the longer Greek II version Most English translations since 1966 have relied on the
