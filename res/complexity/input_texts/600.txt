IPA \) is a hoppy beer style within the broader category of pale ale The export style of pale ale , which had become known as India pale ale , developed in England around 1840 , later became a popular product there It became popular among East India Company traders in the late 18th century because of the brewery 's location near the East India Docks in Blackwall , East London IPAs have a long history in Canada and the United States , and many breweries there produce a version of the style History The pale ales of the early 18th century were lightly hopped and quite different from today 's pale ales By the mid 18th century , pale ale was mostly brewed with coke fired malt , which produced less smoking and roasting of barley in the malting process , and hence produced a paler beer One such variety of beer was October beer , a pale well hopped brew popular among the landed gentry , who brewed it domestically once brewed it was intended to cellar two years thumb 262x262px 19th century poster for Phipps , an IPA brewer in Northampton Among the first brewers known to export beer to India was George Hodgson 's Bow Brewery , on the Middlesex Essex border Bow Brewery beers became popular among East India Company traders in the late 18th century because of the brewery 's location near the East India Docks and Hodgson 's liberal credit line of 18 months Ships transported Hodgson 's beers to India , among them his October beer , which benefited exceptionally from conditions of the voyage and was apparently highly regarded among its consumers in India Bow Brewery came into the control of Hodgson 's son in the early 19th century , but his business practices alienated their customers During the same period , several Burton breweries lost their European export market in Russia when the Tsar banned the trade , and were seeking a new export market for their beer At the behest of the East India Company , Allsopp 's brewery developed a strongly hopped pale ale in the style of Hodgson 's for export to India Other Burton brewers , including Bass and Salt , were eager to replace their lost Russian export market and quickly followed Allsopp 's lead Perhaps as a result of the advantages of Burton water in brewing , Burton India pale ale was preferred by merchants and their customers in India , but Hodgson 's October beer clearly influenced the Burton brewers' India pale ales Brewer Charrington 's trial shipments of hogsheads of India Ale to Madras and Calcutta in 1827 proved successful and a regular trade emerged with the key British agents and retailers Griffiths Co in Madras Adam , Skinner and Co in Bombay and Bruce , Allen Co in Calcutta Early IPAs like Hodgson 's , and those produced by the Burton brewers , were only slightly higher in alcohol than most of the other beers brewed in their day and would not have been considered strong ales however , a greater proportion of the wort was well fermented , leaving behind few residual sugars , and the beer was strongly hopped discusses the hopping rate discusses the high level of fermentation The common story that early IPAs were much stronger than other beers of the time , however , is a myth While IPAs were formulated to survive long voyages by sea better than other styles of the time , porter was also shipped to India and California successfully It is clear that by the 1860s , India pale ales were widely brewed in England , and that they were much more attenuated and highly hopped than porters and many other ales Demand for the export style of pale ale , which had become known as India pale ale , developed in England around 1840 and India pale ale became a popular product in England In 1837 , Hodgson 's IPA typically cost 6s 6d for a dozen pint bottles , the same as Guinness Double Stout , and significantly more than the 4s 3d a dozen for a Porter beer WANDSWORTH IN THE FIELDS In thorough Times , 15 June 1837 , p 2 The Times Digital Archive Some brewers dropped the term India in the late 19th century , but records indicated that these pale ales retained the features of earlier IPAs American , Australian , and Canadian brewers manufactured beer with the label IPA before 1900 , and records suggest that these beers were similar to English IPA of the era IPA style beers started being exported to other colonial countries , such as Australia and New Zealand , around this time with many breweries dropping the 'I' in 'IPA' and simply calling them Pale Ales or Export Pales Many breweries , such as Kirkstall Brewery , sent large quantities of export beer across the world by steam ship to auction off to wholesalers upon arrival United Kingdom thumb 352x352px Best India Pale Ale , bottled expressly for export by A W Palmer Co India Pale Ale , or IPA , has been used in the United Kingdom to describe a well hopped , high gravity beer since 1835 It gained popularity in the domestic market after 1841 , and the term is still commonly used , as in Greene King IPA and Charles Wells Eagle IPA United States Contemporary American IPAs are typically brewed with distinctively American hops , such as Cascade , Centennial , Citra , Columbus , Chinook , Simcoe , Amarillo , Tomahawk , Warrior , Neomexicanus , and Nugget East Coast IPAs are distinguished from West Coast IPAs by a stronger malt presence , which balances the intensity of the hops , whereas hops are more prominent in the western brews , possibly because of the proximity of West Coast breweries to hop fields in the Pacific Northwest East Coast breweries rely more on spicier European hops and specialty malts than those on the West Coast Double IPAs \( also referred to as Imperial IPAs \) are a stronger , very hoppy variant of IPAs that typically have alcohol content above 7 5 by volume American Double IPA Beer Advocate Retrieved 30 May 2013 The style is claimed to have originated with Vinnie Cilurzo , currently the owner of Russian River Brewing Company in Santa Rosa , California , in 1994 at the now defunct Blind Pig Brewery in Temecula , California The style has been embraced by the craft brewers of San Diego County , California , to such an extent that double IPAs have been referred to as San Diego pale ale by Garrett Oliver , brewmaster at the Brooklyn Brewery In the United States , sales of IPAs have increased , helping drive the craft beer renaissance As such , IPAs frequently top the lists of several beer awards annually For example , Bell 's Brewery 's Two Hearted Ale has been awarded the Best Beer in America for three consecutive years starting in 2017 in years prior , Two Hearted Ale often placed second after another IPA , Pliny the Elder , a double IPA brewed by Russian River Brewing Company The most awarded IPA to date is Goose Island IPA , with 6 medals New England India pale ales are a style of IPA invented in Vermont in the early 2010s They are characterized by juicy , citrus , and floral flavours , with an emphasis on hop aroma with low
