The Maratha Kranti Morcha , loosely translated as Maratha revolutionary demonstration in the Marathi language , is a series of silent protests organized by the Maratha community in various cities across India as well as overseas Other groups , such as religious minorities including Muslims , have also supported the Morcha The impetus for the rallies is the rape and murder of a 15 year old girl in Kopardi village , Maharashtra , on 13 July 2016 The protesters have demanded the death sentence for the rapists The rallies feature no leaders and no slogans Millions of people from all parts of Maharashtra came together to protest , and initially no harm was done to any public or private property until a few instances of violence were noted in January 2017 The demand for reservations in educational positions and government jobs has also been a part of these protests Recently , the Bombay High Court upheld the reservations granted to the Maratha community but also mentioned that the percentage of quotas given was n't justifiable A large percentage of Marathis are farmers , and the community has been severely affected by droughts and degraded arable land Due to the lack of reservations , unemployment has become a major problem in the Maratha community Some castes within the Maratha community , known as Kunbi , do receive the benefits of reservations provided to the Other Backward Class category however , most people are allegedly out of benefits More than 95 of the Maratha are socially and educationally backward Demands Punishment of culprits in the Kopardi rape and murder case Reservations in educational positions and government jobs Implementation of recommendations of the National Commission on Farmers chaired by Dr M S Swaminathan Amendment of Scheduled
