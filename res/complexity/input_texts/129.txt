of McLaren in 3rd place In the battle for fourth , Toyota led Red Bull by one point Red Bull led Renault by a further point after Nelsinho Piquet came 2nd in the 2008 German Grand Prix Force India

2005 , Fernando Alonso won his maiden Grand Prix for Renault in 2003 , whilst Brazil 's Rubens Barrichello won the 2002 race for Ferrari Before the race , testing was taking place at Jerez Report Background Prior to the race , all teams conducted testing sessions at Circuito Permanente de Jerez between 22 25 July Sebastian Vettel of Toro Rosso dominated most of the first day 's session , carrying out testing on aero and mechanical work Ferrari 's Luca Badoer and Toyota 's Jarno Trulli tested on Bridgestone slick tires , as a preparation for 2009 season BMW Sauber 's test driver Christian Klien tested the new KERS system for their modified F1 07C car , another change slated for the next season Unfortunately he could not continue after a brief first run when one of the mechanics suffered an electric shock when the car came into the pits The team hence decided to halt the testing of the new electric system Vettel topped the testing timecharts again on Wednesday He , along with Red Bull 's Mark Webber and Honda 's Alexander Wurz tried out the Bridgestone slick tires Force India started their testing on Wednesday with their VJM01 's new seamless shift gearbox through test driver Vitantonio Liuzzi Both Trulli and Ferrari 's Kimi R ikk nen tested focusing on forthcoming races Many of the teams tested the new slick tires during their Thursday testing Webber topped the lap timings while working on aero development work and suspension changes R ikk nen and Liuzzi continued their tasks from previous day Timo Glock returned to testing for his team Toyota for the first time since his accident in the previous race McLaren 's Pedro de la Rosa ran a short testing session due to an oil leak and engine change Heikki Kovalainen , who joined the McLaren team on the final day , was fastest in testing The teams focused mainly on evaluating the car changes ahead of the race Practice In the first practice on Friday August 1 , Ferraris of Massa and R ikk nen led the timesheets ahead of their McLaren counterparts Kovalainen and Hamilton Renault 's Fernando Alonso was fifth , with Glock in Toyota coming sixth Sebastian Vettel of Toro Rosso ran a short stint of mere four laps when a mechanical problem forced him to end his run He ended up at the bottom of the charts The second practice had Hamilton as their leader , with Piquet Jr running second Their respective teammates Kovalainen and Alonso were third and fourth Vettel once again failed to record significant lap timings when his car failed following a five laps run due to a similar problem from the earlier session Saturday 's session once again had Hamilton at the top , with Massa and Glock second and third Kovalainen and Piquet Jr were fourth and fifth Heidfeld in BMW Sauber managed sixth position , but his teammate Robert Kubica was forced towards the bottom of the pack due to a mechanical failure Qualifying In Qualifying 1 , Hamilton and Massa set the early pace , with Hamilton over six tenths of a second quicker than his teammate Kovalainen R ikk nen found himself being pushed in to 6th place behind the two Toyotas of Glock and Trulli , while Nick Heideld was the big name knocked out in the first session , after he was blocked by Sebastien Bourdais on his final flying lap \( which , prior to the block , would have lifted Heidfeld out of the knockout zone \) Heidfeld , Nakajima , Barichello , Fisichella and Sutil were therefore eliminated In Qualifying 2 , Massa set the quickest time of both sessions so far , with Glock putting in an incredibly quick lap to put himself ahead of both McLarens , with Kovalainen reducing the gap between himself and Hamilton in this session R ikk nen again found himself behind Trulli , well off his teammate 's pace Nico Rosberg did not take part in the session , while Sebastien Vettel was just 1 hundredth of a second away from reaching the third session Vettel , Button , Coulthard , Bourdais and Rosberg would be eliminated in this session In Qualifying 3 , Glock set the early pace with his first lap being the benchmark for the first half of the session Hamilton would set the quickest time , however , with Kovalainen managing to beat Massa to second place Kubica was able to find some pace in the BMW for the first time in the weekend , while Glock slotted in ahead of R ikk nen who struggled all through qualifying Alonso and Webber made up the fourth row , while Trulli slipped down to 9th with Nelson Piquet Jr managing to qualify his Renault in 10th place After the session was over , Bourdais was docked five grid places for blocking Heidfeld , meaning he would start the race in 19th place Race Massa jumped both McLarens on the run down to the first corner off the grid , putting himself in first position Kubica lost a place to Glock , while R ikk nen lost out to Alonso further down the field , Vettel ran wide at the final corner and lost several positions Massa and Hamilton quickly pulled away from Kovalainen Massa was surprisingly quicker than Hamilton , given the McLaren driver 's superior pace earlier in the weekend By the time Massa came in to the pits on Lap 17 , he had extended four second lead over Hamilton With Hamilton coming in to the pits just a lap later , it seemed that the Ferrari was not just fuelled slightly lighter than the McLaren , but was genuinely quicker as well The same could not be said for R ikk nen however , as the reigning champion found himself stuck behind Alonso 's Renault Massa rejoined the track just ahead of Alonso and his teammate , while Hamilton came out just behind the battle , losing time over the next two laps Once the lead cars had made their first stops , the top four of Massa , Hamilton , Kovalainen and Glock remained unchanged Albeit Kubica dropped from 5th to 9th after making an early stop Vettel retired on lap 22 after his engine overheated at his pit stop , burning parts of the car David Coulthard stayed out until lap 29 , managing to reach a high of 5th before dropping back to 13th due to a part of his floor being damaged and flailing A number of cars in the mid field then had problems during their first stops , starting with Sebastien Bourdais' Toro Rosso catching fire after fuel spilled from the refuelling rig the pit crew extinguished this immediately before finishing the refuelling Nakajima 's Williams then caught fire as it left the pits , but the wind put that fire out Rubens Barichello 's car also suffered a minor fire as he was refuelling With Massa extending his lead to Hamilton to five seconds , the McLaren driver pushed until lap 40 when he developed a puncture Managing to drive the car back to the pits , Hamilton would return to the track in 10th place , just ahead of Coulthard however , he was fuelled to the end of the race Massa now had a 23 second lead over Kovalainen , and started to ease off in order to save his engine The leading three all made their stops shortly after Hamilton 's puncture , with Glock falling to 5th temporarily as Piquet Jr and Trulli continued their race long battle Further back in the field , Giancarlo Fisichella struck both Bourdais and Nakajima in seperate incidents , albeit all three cars continued in the race R ikk nen finally managed to pass Alonso in the second round of stops , with Hamilton working his way up to 6th behind Alonso R ikk nen managed to quickly catch Glock , being around 1 5 second quicker than the Toyota driver , and started to put pressure on him with around 10 laps left in the race Adrian Sutil 's Force India , meanwhile , had what appeared to be a brake failure on the main straight , a plume of brake dust shooting from the back of the car Sutil retired after a precautionary stop and a couple more laps With 5 laps remaining , R ikk nen was less than a second behind Glock , but unable to find a way past the Toyota driver , who was still on course for his first ever podium Hamilton had closed the gap to Alonso to 3 seconds by this point Then with 3 laps remaining , Massa 's had an engine failure on the main straight , gifting the lead to Kovalainen R ikk nen soon eased off the chase against Glock , knowing that he also had inherited the podium as long as he finishes Kovalainen scored his first win , with Glock claiming his maiden podium in second , and R ikk nen finished third Alonso settled for fourth and Hamilton recovered from the earlier puncture to finish 5th , trailing 1 5 seconds behind Alonso Piquet , Trulli and Kubica rounded the top eight 18 of 20 runners were classified in the race Classification
