Daniel Jonah Goldhagen , author of Hitler 's Willing Executioners has written a book about the Catholic Church s role in the Holocaust , A Moral Reckoning According to Geoffrey Wheatcroft , reviewing the book in the New York Times In A Moral Reckoning , Goldhagen now turns from nation to religion , and indicts the Roman Catholic Church in comparable terms Both as an international institution under the leadership of Pope Pius XII , and at national levels in many European countries , the church was deeply implicated in the appalling genocide Nor was it merely a question of complicity Just as Germans had been carefully taught to hate the Jews , to the point that they could readily torment and kill them , so had Catholics , Goldhagen believes He does not accept the idea that National Socialism was more pagan than Christian in its inspiration he sees a deep vein of Jew hatred ingrained within Catholic tradition and he does not think that there was any difference of kind between that old religious Jew hatred and the murderous racial anti Semitism of the 20th century Geoffrey Wheatcroft Sins of the Father New York Times Nov 2 , 2002 Donald Dietrich , a professor at Boston College specializing in Holocaust studies , has a similar description of the book in his review Daniel Jonah Goldhagen s 1996 book , Hitler s Willing Executioners , Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust , elicited a great deal of contentious debate , and it is likely that this most recent book will continue that tradition In this polemical study , Goldhagen asks the Catholic Church a question What must a religion of love and goodness do to confront its history of hatred and harm , to make amends with its victims , and to right itself so that it is no longer the source of hatred and harm that , whatever its past , it would no longer endorse \?
