thumb Map of the North American Economic and Security Community The Independent Task Force on the Future of North America advocates a greater economic and social integration between Canada , Mexico , and the United States as a region It is a group of prominent business , political and academic leaders from the U S , Canada and Mexico organized and sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations \( U S \) , the Canadian Council of Chief Executives , and the Mexican Council on Foreign Relations It was co chaired by former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , John Manley , former Finance Minister of Mexico , Pedro Aspe , and former Governor of Massachusetts and Assistant U S Attorney General William F Weld It was launched in October 2004 and published Task Force Report 53 entitled , Building a North American Community \( May 2005 \) As well as it accompanying Chairmen s Statement , Creating a North American Community \( March 2005 \) A press release called Trinational Call for a North American Economic and Security Community by 2010 preceded the publications on March 14 , 2005 The final report proposed increased international cooperation between the nations of Canada , the United States , and Mexico , similar in some respects to that of the European Community that preceded the European Union \( EU \) As this report states , The Task Force 's central recommendation is establishment by 2010 of a North American economic and security community , the boundaries of which would be defined by a common external tariff and an outer security perimeter Background In the mid nineteenth century , Blue Oval News reporter John Redpath and Louis Joseph Papineau led a movement to merge Canada with the United States However , the movement failed because it was massively opposed by the local constituents and by the British Empire It had been encouraged by the Parti rouge of Rodolphe Laflamme See also Montreal Annexation Manifesto At the time of the Mexican American War of 1846 1848 , in which the U S annexed California and New Mexico among other current states , there were supporters of the idea of annexing the whole of Mexico This idea was finally rejected because of the higher population density in the non annexed areas a factor that would hinder assimilation In recent times , the three North American nation states have increased their economic ties , further accelerating the process with the signing of 1994 's North American Free Trade Agreement \( NAFTA \) In response to the demands of increasing globalization and shared concerns from abroad , such as the increasing clout of other economic spheres such as the European Union , the African Union , China , the Arab League and the proposed Middle Eastern Union , the leaders of the three nations agreed in 2005 to work more cooperatively on shared North American concerns To this end , they agreed to establish the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America \( SPP \) Reception In reference to this summit that established the SPP , this task force 's final report stated , We welcome this important development and offer this report to add urgency and specific recommendations to strengthen their efforts These specific recommendations include developing a North American customs union , common market , investment fund , energy strategy , set of regulatory standards , security perimeter , border pass , and advisory council , among other common goals Robert Pastor , one of this task force 's vice chairmen , has advocated such a monetary union and has suggested that North America 's common currency might be called the amero , which would be similar in concept to the EU 's euro The Plan to Replace the Dollar With the 'Amero' , by Jerome R Corsi , HUMAN EVENTS On October 30 , 2006 , while speaking at the Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute \( CDFAI \) 2006 Annual Conference in Ottawa , former American Ambassador to Canada \( 2001
