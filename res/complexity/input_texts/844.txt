course was at that time called HMCW \( Higher Medical Course for Women \) The course listeners were called medichki The first medichki graduation was in spring 1912 Due to the popularity of the course , the entrance competition was very high In 1906 , the medical faculty students numbered 206 and in 1907 1908 there were 285 Therewith , 2128 applicants for study were rejected So , the entrance competition equaled almost 9 people for one position Since the establishment of the HMCW medical department up to the February Revolution of 1917 , a total of 1060 students were trained there The revolutionary events of 1917 gave an incentive to a new wave in the history of HMCW The Interim Government Herald \( Vestnik Vremennogo Pravitelstva \) informed about the legislation of the draft for the transformation of women courses into women universities However no practical implementation of the legislation followed On top of that , the study years 1917 1918 started off with huge complications and in November the studies were dismissed On October 16 , 1918 the People 's Commisariat Board decreed to transform HMCW into 2nd Moscow State University \( 2nd MSU \) , thus becoming a new educational establishment of mixed character without considering the former a separate educational establishment 2nd MSU existed up to 1930 Later on , as a result of reorganization 3 independent institutes came to existence including 2nd Moscow State Medical Institute \( 2nd MSMI \) Then a period of progressive development started and lasted till the World War This includes the formation of new departments and faculties Each department had a scientific student society of its own During the early days of war , when the state examinations were over after spring , practically all the graduates were sent to the Red Army Forces Throughout all the years of war , the institute operated as usual and kept on training specialists On November 23 , 1946 on account of 40 years of its foundation , the USSR Presidium of the Supreme Soviet decree decided to honour the institute with the name of I V Stalin From that year onwards up to 1957 , the institute was officially called 2nd MSMI named after I V Stalin Ratings In 2014 , the Russian rating agency Expert RA included it in its list of rated universities of higher educational of the Commonwealth of Independent States ,
