The Gender Parity Index \( GPI \) is a socioeconomic index usually designed to measure the relative access to education of males and females In its simplest form , it is calculated as the quotient of the number of females by the number of males enrolled in a given stage of education \( primary , secondary , etc \) It is used by international organizations , particularly in measuring the progress of developing countries The Institute for Statistics of UNESCO also uses a more general definition of GPI for any development indicator one can define the GPI relative to this indicator by dividing its value for females by its value for males For example , some UNESCO documents consider gender parity in literacy UNESCO describes attempts to eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education and emphasizes the plight of girls in unequal access in third world countries In true feminist fashion , though , it ignores the gender disparity that benefits first world women in tertiary education In Iceland , for example , 65 of students enrolling in tertiary education are female But because this disparity benefits women , there is n't any concern about equality from the feminist dominated United Nations See also Gender Empowerment Measure Gender related Development Index Gender equality Gender inequality References Category Socioeconomics Category Index numbers Category Gender studies
