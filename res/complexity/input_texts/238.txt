Sahih is an Islamic term that means authentic It is commonly used to describe the authenticity of a Hadith Definition Sunni Muslims use the term the Two Sahihs referring to Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim , since they consider them to contain only Sahih Hadith Similarly , the Six Sahihs refers to the two Sahihs and in addition the four other famous collections , being Abu Dawud , al Tirmidhi , Ibn Majah and al Nasa'i Altogether , there are forty nine books of authenticated hadith collections , which include , apart from these six more famous ones , also the Muwatta' Imam Malik , Musnad Imam Abu Hanifah , Musnad Imam Shafi'i , Musnad Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal , Bayhaqi , Darimi , Dar Qutni , Jami' Kabir , Jami' Saghir , Mustadrak Hakim , etc Related Terms Musnad Musnad is a term used in the science of hadith to classify a certain type of hadith The scholar of hadith , Muhammad ibn Abdullah al Hakim , defines a musnad \( supported \) hadith as A hadith which a traditionalist reports from his shaykh \( i e teacher of hadith \) from whom he is known to have heard \( i e studied \) at a time of life suitable for learning , and similarly in turn for each shaykh \( i e teacher of hadith \) until the isnad reaches a well known Sahaba \( i e , companion of the Prophet muhammad \) , who in turn reports from the Prophet Muhammad Islam Online Hadith Its Sciences Hadiths where there is a break in the isnad are not considered musnad Moreover , those hadiths that are not narrated to be the words of Muhammad would also not be considered musnad An example of a musnad hadith as reported by al Hakim is as follows We reported from Abu Amr 'Uthman ibn Ahmad al Sammak al Baghdadi from al Hassan ibn Mukarram from Uthman ibn Amr from Yunus ibn Zaid from al Zuhri from Abdullah ibn Ka'b ibn Malik from his father''' \( Ka'b ibn Malek who had asked ibn Abi Hadrad \( a Sahaba \) for payment of a debt he owed to him in the mosque During the ensuing argument , their voices were raised until heard by the Messenger of Allah \( Muhammad \) , who eventually lifted the curtain of his apartment and said , O Ka'b ! Write off a part of your debt So he \( Ka'b \) agreed , and the man paid him This hadith fulfills all the characteristics required of a musnad hadith First , each of the narrators \( e g Abu Amr 'Uthman ibn Ahmad al Sammak al Baghdadi , al Hassan ibn Mukarram , etc \) is known to have studied hadith from the person he reports from Moreover , this hadith includes the saying of Muhammad himself as part of the hadith MuttasilMuttasil \( is an Islamic term used in the Hadith evaluation process It means that the hadith has an uninterrupted isnad Not only does it mean that the transmiters need to have lived at the same date , it must be know that they have met each other Islam Online Hadith Its Sciences Shia 's use of sahih books Shia do not believe that the sahih books are completely authentic only a small percentage of the hadith are accepted by the Shia Even though Shia do n't believe the sahih books contain hadiths that are all authentic , they do use some hadiths from those books to argue that the ideology of the Shia is right For example , in the Sahih Bukhari it is mentioned that Uthman ran away from the battle of Uhud Running away from battle is a capital sin in Islam Shia use this hadith to argue that Uthman could not have been the ruler of all Muslims if he committed capital sins It can , however , be argued that the Qur'an states that all those who fled from Uhud were forgiven 3 155 Those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts met \( i e the battle of Uhud \) , it was Shaitan \( Satan \) who caused them to backslide \( run away from the battlefield \) because of some \( sins \) they had earned But Allah , indeed , has forgiven them Surely , Allah is OftForgiving , Most Forbearing '' References External links The Classification Of Hadith According To The Reliability And Memory Of Reporters Category Arabic words and phrases Category Science of hadith ar it Sahih ms Hadis Sahih tr Sahih
