Germanos Karavangelis \( , also transliterated as Yermanos and Karavaggelis or Karavagelis , 1866 1935 \) was born in Stipsi , a village on the island of Lesbos He was a metropolitan bishop of Kastoria , in communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople , from 1900 until 1907 , appointed in the name of the Greek state by the ambassador of Greece Nikolaos Mavrokordatos \( \) , , 1959 and was one of the main coordinators of the Greek Struggle for Macedonia that had an aim to defend the Greek and Greek Orthodox clerical interests against the Turks and the Bulgarians in then Ottoman Turkish ruled Macedonia During the Macedonian struggle , Karavangelis directed the Greek response to supporters of the Bulgarian cause , the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization \( VMRO \) and the Exarchate At the time Karavangelis would travel in rural areas , and portrayed a fierce romanticized image of himself dressed with a dark raincoat , a bandolier on side of his shoulder and a gun on the other with a scarf tied around his clerical hat Karavangelis viewed Bulgarian influence within the area as a threat to Greek interests He advocated for close relations and interaction among Turks and Greeks in the region , only in the context of when it was needed Karavangelis viewed the rivalry between the Patriarchate and Exarchate as without religious dimensions and that the main concern preoccupying Balkan states was the post Ottoman future of in the region after the empire was removed from Macedonia Greece at the time sent more funds , men and arms to individuals such as Karavangelis in Macedonia Glenny , Misha The Balkans Nationalism , War , and the Great Powers , 1804 1999 London Granta Books , 1999 p 206 in the Macedonian villages genuinely committed to the Bulgarian Exarchate of VMRO , the Greeks behaved like vengeful bullies , executing suspected renegades and holding the Greek Patriarchate version of the Mass at gunpoint \( \) This Greek blacklash was orchestrated by the gun toting bishop of Kastoria , Germanos Karavangelis This extraordinary figure , \( \) 'had a M nnlicher slung over one shoulder , a bandolier over the other , a belt round his middle from which hung his holster carrying a large pistol and a knife' Karavangelis appeared consciously to cultivate an image of threatening romanticism The bishop considered Bulgarian influence in the region to be the greatest threat to Greek national interests He therefore advocated close friendship and cooperation between the Greeks and Turks of Macedonia , but only as an expedient Karavangelis was fully aware that there was no religious aspect to the struggle between the Exarcate and the Patriarchate he admitted openly that the only issue in Macedonia was the future contours of the Balkan states once the Turks had been thrown out Citing Douglas Dankin , The Greek struggle in Macedonia 1897 1913 , Thessaloniki , 1966 , p 126 He organized armed groups composed mainly of Greek army officers , volunteers brought from Crete , Peloponnese and other parts of Greek populated areas , as well as recruited local Macedonian Greeks such as the chieftain Vangelis Strebreniotis from the village of Srebreni \( now Asprogeia \) , and Konstantinos Kottas , a former member of Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization \( IMRO \) from the village of Rulya \( later renamed Kottas by the Greek authorities in his honour \) In 1905 , Orthodox priest Kristo Negovani in his native village conducted the divine liturgy in the Albanian Tosk dialect and for his efforts was murdered on orders from Bishop Karavangelis who had condemned during mass the use of Albanian Negovani s actions caused institutional responses that ultimately intensified the contradictions facing the church and its imperial patron In the end , Papa Kristo Negovani was murdered for his acts of defiance of the explicit orders of Karavangjelis , the Metropolitan of Kastoria , who condemned the use of Tosk risht during mass Karavangelis succeeded to strengthen Greek aspirations in Macedonia and thus helped the later incorporation of the major part of Macedonia by Greece in the Balkan Wars , for which he is praised as a national hero of the Greek Struggle for Macedonia \( makedonomachos \) He is the author of the book of memoirs The Macedonian Struggle \( \) See also Greek Struggle for Macedonia Pavlos
