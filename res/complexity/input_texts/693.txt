The Royal Masonic School for Girls is an independent school in Rickmansworth , England with both day and boarding pupils The school was instituted in 1788 , with the aim of maintaining the daughters of indigent Freemasons , unable through death , illness , or incapacitation to support their families Today , the school accepts the children of both masons and non masons It began in 1789 with fifteen pupils and a Matron in Somers Place , East London During its history , the school has moved premises three times , twice within London and finally in 1934 to Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire , where it still is today Currently the school still sits there at Rickmansworth Park It is a day school for girls 4 18 , a boarding school for girls 7 18 and a new nursury opened in 2009 for boys and girls aged 2 4 The school sits on its 316 acre site In the beginning In 1788 , Bartholomew Ruspini and nine fellow Freemasons met to discuss plans for establishing a charitable institution for the daughters of Masons who had fallen on hard times or whose death had meant hardship for their families On 14 May 1788 , a committee met at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street to thrash out the details of the proposed institution An advertisement for the position of Matron was put in the papers , and the committee set about finding a suitable premises from which their charity could operate The house at Sommers Place East was a suggestion from Dr de Valangin , and was taken in October at rent of 35 per annum to house 15 children The property has since disappeared but was between the present day Euston and St Pancras stations , approximately where the British Library is today The original advertisement for the Matron read as follows ROYAL CUMBERLAND FREE MASON SCHOOL Little Chelsea Wanted a Matron to reside in the House and instruct the Children in Reading , Writing , Housewifery , and every necessary use of the Needle She must be of the Established Religion of the Church of England A middle Aged , Well Educated Single Woman will be preferred Proposals in writing to be sent to the Secretary , 121 , Pall Mall Twenty replies were received , of which five were shortlisted The decision was arrived at by means of ballot , and Mrs Ann Le Clerc was duly elected She is referred to in the minutes of the meeting as a governess , and her address is given as 11 Wells Street , Marylebone The term Mrs was used for single and married women alike , so it is unknown as to whether she was married or not On 5 January 1789 , the children met at Ruspini 's house and walked in procession to the house The ceremonial procession was reported in the Morning Post \( later to become absorbed by the Daily Telegraph \) and the Daily Advertiser on Saturday 10 January The names of the children were listed with their birth and baptismal records Harriet Ann Vinet 17 04 1782 Sarah Jane Sitgraves 23 01 1780 Ann Kane 27 11 1780 Margaret Burgess 08 08 1781 Catherine

Richardson 01 04 1781 Sophia Kewney 29 01 1780 Ann Martin 17 07 1781 Elizabeth Lowe 21 08 1782 Of the fifteen , Charlotte Richardson was removed from the school by her parents within a couple of months She was replaced by Charlotte Hatton Also , Mary Bagley had petitioned for a place at the school but had been rejected , having been found to be too old The governors , however , decided to keep her on as an assistant servant , getting maintenance , clothing , and her education in return Although called a school , the institution was not what we might call a school until the mid nineteenth century In its early stages , it was more of an orphanage , although many of the girls had at least one parent living At the end of their school life , girls were either returned to their family or supporters \( known as Friends \) or apprenticed and supported until they could establish themselves The children could be from any part of the United Kingdom and had to be between the ages of six and nine They had to be the daughters of freemasons and were required to be in good health , having already had smallpox or cowpox and be free from infirmity of deformity It is known , however , that Frances Sansum from the first fifteen had only one leg Location St George 's Fields Although Ruspini and his fellow freemasons had intended the school to be a permanent establishment , even they had no idea how successful it would be The house originally intended for 15 girls , a matron and a maid soon became too small with the addition of 5 new pupils at the end of the first year and a further five after that By 1790 discussion of finding a bigger site had begun It was decided that a new building would be built The place for the new school was St George 's Fields , that is today 28 Westminster Bridge Road Clapham J St John 's Hill , Battersea Rise was the school 's third location , although there seems to have been some confusion as to whether the school was in Battersea , Clapham , Wandsworth , or Putney when its address was written down The girls , however , referred to it as Clapham J In 1853 , when the site was purchased , it was because of its wide open aspect and country air , qualities that would later be lost The school , however , was still expanding and in 1918 , the junior girls moved to a new junior school in Weybridge in Surrey thumb 300px right The girls of Alex house 1966 Rickmansworth Park By June 1926 , the school was again ready to move , to a site in Rickmansworth standing in of land with a mansion \( although reports suggest this was in a state of disrepair \) To ensure that the site would be suitable for many years to come , a lot of thought was put into the design of the new school buildings , and the following recommendations were made the buildings should be appropriate for 400 girls the boarding houses should house 50 girls , with each dormitory sleeping 16 classrooms should be suitable for classes of 30 there could be a central dining room capable of seating all 400 at one time that a gymnasium , swimming bath , and chapel were required John Leopold Denman , an architect from Brighton , won the commission to design the school The Weybridge Girls thumb 300px right RMS Weybridge 1963 Originally , RMS Rickmansworth was just for the senior girls \( aged 12 and above \) but in 1973 , it was decided that RMS Weybridge , where the junior school was , would move to join their older sisters , forming the combined site that it is today History Food and Clothing We understand far more about nutrition now than was understood when the school began A diet table was drawn up for the girls that was partly transcribed from other charities and partly based on the observations of Mr Boys , a governor and surgeon The diet allowed a ration of 2 pounds of meat per child per week Below shows the menu for breakfast , dinner , and supper Sunday Rice milk Roast beef , vegetables , bread Bread , butter Monday Water Gruel Suet pudding Bread , cheese , Tuesday Milk Porridge Boiled mutton , vegetables , bread , Broth and bread Wednesday Rice Milk Suet puddings , potatoes , bread Bread , butter Thursday Water Gruel Boiled beef , vegetables , bread Broth and bread Friday Milk Porridge Rice puddings Bread , cheese Saturday Rice and milk Boiled beef , vegetables , bread Broth and bread The war years WWI Unlike the Second World War , much of what went on was away from home and life at the school continued pretty much as normal Two exceptions include an incident in 1917 where the school was damaged by anti aircraft fire , and 1919 when the girls gave up their prizes on prize day so that the money could be given to charity WWII In order to protect the girls from the expected aerial bombardment , an air raid shelter had been dug out This was behind the boarding house formerly known as Ruspini and now known as Alexandra The shelter was commonly referred to as the trenches and consisted of underground tunnels that zig zagged with a room at intervals for boiling a kettle or dispensing medicines The tunnels were lined with benches wide and each girl was allocated a place she must find in a raid They were all kept together in houses , and each section was given a name such as Ruspini Row , Atholl Square , Cumberland Place , and Moira Mansions The girls themselves wanted to play their part and formed their own land army , tending the kitchen gardens at the school to provide fruit and vegetables and helping out with domestic duties They also adopted 3 ships , but most notably the Ocean Courier The girls knitted socks , gloves , and other items which were sent to the ship at Christmas In return , Captain Crastion , the ship 's captain , sent the school 36 pounds of toffee The captain visited the school , and he and his ship also took part in the action on D Day , carrying men and munitions Headmasters Mistresses Sarah Louisa Davis Head Governess 1861 1896 Emily Redgrave Head Governess 1896 \?

School Badge thumb left 150px Traditional crest taken from a school bookmark thumb right 200px RMS Badge taken from a school blazer as from 1990 At each side of the design are two pillars In the centre is a five pointed star At the bottom of the new badge , and centre of the old badge is the smooth Ashlar At the top of the old badge are the letters R M I G standing for Royal Masonic Institution for girls On the new badge is the school motto , Circumornatae ut similitudo templi , which is the Vulgate version of a phrase from Psalm 144 12 That our daughters may be as the polished corners of the temple School Drill The school drill is akin to something expected on an army parade ground Some of it originates in Swedish Drill , and some is based on calisthenics When exercising began to be incorporated into girls' education there were no trained women P E teachers , so drilling was under the guidance of an Army drill instructor The marching , counter marching and arm stretches were considered the only exercise suitable for a young lady Described originally as callisthenics , exercises and marching no one is entirely sure when school drill began In an extract from the school magazine Machio in 1962 , school drill is purported to be a hundred years old There is a reference to it is an account of prize day 1876 although it is not referred to as drill It was performed to music on a piano , later 2 grand pianos and consisted of 180 girls \( the number of degrees in a semicircle \) In 1980 the music was recorded and the spoken commands gave way to a whistle The girls learn their positions \( based on their height , and thus changing from year to year and needing to be re learned \) and move in time to the music from one point to the next The end of the performance is marked by the girls producing the Masonic emblem of set square and compass , and the point , the smallest child in the performance marching forward alone to complete the symbol Duo and Trio Duo and Trio are a tradition upheld at prize day 6 pianos in a row are played by either 2 \( duo \) or 3 \( trio \) girls simultaneously Ashlar thumb The Ashlar silver badge of the RMS School The Ashlar is the silver badge that all RMS girls strive to achieve by the end of Year 11 The award of the Ashlar shows that a girl has been recognised for her contribution to school life , her sense of personal responsibility and her responsibility to others The school motto comes from Psalm 144 , That our daughters may be as the polished cornerstones of the Temple Interesting facts The Royal
