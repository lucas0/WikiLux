Musik \( English translation Music \) was the Austrian entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1971 , performed in Viennese \( a dialect of German spoken in Vienna \) by Marianne Mendt The song was performed first on the night \( followed by Malta 's Joe Grech with Marija l Maltija \) At the close of voting , it had received 66 points , placing it 16th in a field of 18 The song is about the ubiquity of music , although as Mendt sings , it is often sold as something else Marianne 's performance at the ESC was pretty fair at best Her main problem was that she was trying too hard in her performance Her preview video was much better with there being a lot of symbolism , with the music switching tempos back and forth between birds flying over the Danube river and a plane flying overhead The original version of the video was a little hard to listen to especially the chorus line had a very annoying high pitch screech singing along with Mendt But orchestration wise , the lyrics feel the beat referred to the birds flying over the lake and feel the drum referred to the plane flying overhead The song was succeeded as Austrian representative in the 1972 Contest by Milestones performing Falter im Wind Category Eurovision songs of Austria Category Eurovision songs of 1971 pt Musik
