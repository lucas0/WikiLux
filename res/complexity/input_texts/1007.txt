server on the tour His best ATP singles ranking to date is world 18 , which he attained in April 2008 Taking advantage of his height , Karlovi is heavily reliant on his serve With a more acute angle from his racquet to the service line , his first serves have a higher chance of coming in , thereby rendering many of them unreachable , let alone returnable With bad returns from his opponents , he normally just has to put the ball away for a winner without the need of a proper volley Some critics say he will not make his mark being a serve only player , but he proved them wrong by beating top players like Lleyton Hewitt , Andy Roddick , Fernando Gonz lez and James Blake , among others He also nearly defeated 1 Roger Federer in a match that ended in a tiebreak in the final set Ga l Monfils

eventual champion Roger Federer In 2005 , Karlovi reached his first ATP final at the Queen 's Club Championships , defeating Lleyton Hewitt and Thomas Johansson along the way In the final he lost to Andy Roddick in a match with no breaks of serve \( 7 6 , 7 6 \) After the final , Roddick said of Karlovi 's serve , It 's probably the biggest weapon in tennis you do n't really get a feel for it unless you are on the other side It was not fun at times At the U S Open , Karlovi pushed eventual finalist Andre Agassi to a 7 6 \( 4 \) , 7 6 \( 5 \) , 7 6 \( 4 \) victory On 19 October , 2005 , he finally defeated long time rival Andy Roddick in the Madrid Masters event In November 2005 , he was a member of the Croatian team that won the Davis Cup He did not play in the finals but played in a

Nottingham , the last grass tune up before Wimbledon , defeating 7 seed Stanislas Wawrinka , Gilles Simon , Juan Mart n del Potro , 2 seed Dmitry Tursunov \( a match played on indoor hard courts due to torrential rain \) , and Arnaud Cl ment As a result , he surpassed his career high from May of last year and broke into the top 45 for the first time Despite a first round loss at Wimbledon , he rose to 40 , making his top 40 debut On 14 October 2007 he won his third title of the year by taking the Stockholm Open , defeating former Australian Open Champion Thomas Johansson in three sets , 6 3 , 3 6 , 6 1 in the final Earlier Karlovi had yet again met Frenchman Arnaud Cl ment in his quarter final , the pair having met 5 times this year alone including in the final of Nottingham earlier in the year where Karlovi secured his second career title Karlovi edged past his rival after saving match point in the final set tiebreak and then went on to defeat German number 1 Tommy Haas in the semi final Karlovi is only the second player to have won titles on three different surfaces this season the other being Roger Federer Uninvolvement in Davis Cup Karlovi has been absent from recent Croatian Davis Cup campaigns due an dispute between himself and Croatian tennis chiefs The reason for the dispute is unequal distribution of the money won by the tennis players Also , Karlovi had never received financial help as a young tennis player from the Croatian Tennis Federation , with all the money going to Ivan Ljubi i , because of the former president of the Croatian tennis federation , Suad Rizvanbegovi It is worth noting that during Croatia 's Davis Cup tie with Great Britain in September 2007 , Goran Ivani evi , a formerly staunch supporter of the squad , was also absent , leading to rumours of a growth in the rift Service Karlovi has been involved in many records of the ATP tour , including most aces in a match , most tiebreaks in a year and came close to serving the most aces in a season , a record that fellow Croatian compatriot Goran Ivani evi holds , with 1477 aces served in 1996 On October 5 , 2007 , Karlovic became the fourth different player to hit more than 1000 aces in one season when he defeated Lleyton Hewitt in the quarterfinals of the ATP event in Tokyo , Japan The only other players to also surpass hitting over 1000 aces in one season are Pete Sampras in 1993 , Karlovic 's fellow countryman Goran Ivani evi in 1994 , 1996 , 1997 , and 1998 , and Andy Roddick in 2004 Ivani evi 's 1996 tally remains the record , and Karlovic said in October 2007 that I think it 's almost unreachable he 's Ivani evi too far ahead I do n't think about it Karlovic finished the year with 1318 aces Karlovi is involved in a notably high number of tiebreaks This is because his serve is so hard to break and because , like many players of his build and serve dominated game , Karlovi is n't the strongest returner in the game \( meaning he breaks his opponents' serve less than perhaps other players \) As a result this has led some top players on the tour to jokingly say they should just play 2 tiebreaks instead of 2 sets when playing Karlovic On 3 August 2007 in his match against Paul Capdeville , Ivo Karlovi hit a second serve of 144 mph , a new world record for fastest second serve On June 21 , 2005 , Karlovi tied the record for most aces hit in a match , having struck 51 past Daniele Bracciali in the first round of the Grand Slam Wimbledon tournament Incidentally , he lost the match after five sets of play He shares the record of 51 with Sweden 's Joachim Johansson Karlovic 's serve is considered to be one of , if not the most feared on the current tour as by most recently being illustrated by narrowly losing 7 6 6 7 6 7 to Rafael Nadal at Queen 's Nadal failed to break Karlovic 's serve in the entire match and even admitted he simply did n't have an answer to it Karlovic hit 35 aces in that particular match Fastest serve Officially , Karlovi 's fastest serve is 153mph , which he recorded en route to beating Frenchman Arnaud Cl ment in the final of Nottingham , 2007 However , commentator and tennis pundit Peter Fleming said at the time during his commentary for Sky Sports that , since this serve was out wide \( as opposed to Andy Roddick 's 155mph which was up the center of the court \) this would translate as being 3 or 4 mph faster than recorded Fleming remarked at the time 153mph out wide is that possible \? Karlovi has said on a number of occasions that he wants and believes he can achieve the record for the world 's fastest serve Trivia During Karlovi 's childhood , his mother Gordana worked in agriculture , while his father Vlado was a meteorologist He married his wife Alsi on March 29 , 2005 One of his favorite activities is playing basketball Karlovi wears size 16 shoes ATPtennis com Players Profiles Career Highlights Biography At the 2008 Australian Open , Karlovi entered the men 's doubles tournament with 6ft 9in John Isner , making them the tallest doubles pair in history They lost 7 6 , 6 3 to Juan Pablo Brzezicki and Agustin Calleri in the first round , although Karlovi commented afterwards It was a lot of fun We will win together next time BBC SPORT Tennis Aussie Open day three quotes Titles \( 5 \) Singles titles \( 4 \) Legend \( Singles \) Grand Slam \( 0 \) Tennis Masters Cup \( 0 \) ATP Masters Series \( 0 \) ATP Tour \( 4 \) No DateTournamentSurfaceOpponent in the finalScore 1 April 9 , 2007 Houston , United States Clay Mariano Zabaleta 6 4 , 6 1 2 June 18 , 2007 Nottingham , United Kingdom Grass Arnaud Cl ment 3 6 , 6 4 , 6 4 3 October 14 , 2007 Stockholm , Sweden Hard \( i \) Thomas Johansson 6 3 , 3 6 , 6 1 4 June 21 , 2008 Nottingham , United Kingdom Grass Fernando Verdasco 7 5 , 6 7 \( 4 \) , 7 6 \( 8 \) Runners up \( 2 \) No DateTournamentSurfaceOpponent in the finalScore 1 23 June , 2005 London , United Kingdom Grass Andy Roddick 7 6 \( 7 \) , 7 6 \( 4 \) 2 18 February , 2007 San Jose , United States Hard Andy Murray 6 7 \( 3 \) , 6 4 , 7 6 \( 2 \) Doubles \( 1 \) No DateTournamentSurfacePartnerOpponents in the finalScore1 February 20 , 2006Memphis , United StatesHard Chris Haggard James Blake Mardy Fish0 6 , 7 5 , 10 5 References External links Karlovi Recent Match Results Karlovi World Ranking History Karlovi Official Website Category 1979 births Category Living people Category Croatian tennis players Category Olympic tennis players of Croatia Category Tennis players at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category People from Zagreb ar bg cs Ivo Karlovi de Ivo Karlovi es Ivo Karlovi fr Ivo Karlovi hr Ivo Karlovi it Ivo Karlovic hu Ivo Karlovi nl Ivo Karlovi ja pl Ivo Karlovi pt Ivo Karlovi sk Ivo Karlovi sv Ivo Karlovi
