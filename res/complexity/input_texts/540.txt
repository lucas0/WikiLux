The Specific Carbohydrate Diet \( SCD \) is an untested nutritional regimen , created by Dr Sidney V Haas and popularized by biochemist and author Elaine Gottschall , which restricts the use of complex carbohydrates \( disaccharides and polysaccharides \) and eliminates refined sugar , all grains and starch from the diet It is promoted as a way of reducing the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome \( IBS \) , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , coeliac disease and autism Gottschall believed that due to damage to the microvili in the body , these microvili lack the ability to breakdown specific types of carbohydrates \( i e disaccharides and polysaccharides \) , resulting in dysbiosis , the overgrowth of harmful bacterial flora In a 1924 study , Haas reported in cases which the diet can be controlled for a sufficient long time , recovery ensues in every instance and without nutritional relapse Haas , S V Value of banana in treatment of celiac disease , Am J Dis Child 28 421 , 1924 In 1922 , Kleinschmidt wrote a scientific paper about the efficacy of Dr Haas' diet , stating the prognosis in celiac disease has undergone a complete change during the last few years The discouraging results of the previous methods of treatment have entirely disappeared since we have followed the diet of the American , Haas Kleinschmidt , H Chronic Diarrhea in children , Jahresk f Arztl Fortbild 13 16 , 1922 In 1928 , Von den Steinen reported on a study which validated the efficacy of Dr Haas' diet and verified its results Treatment of Heubner Herter 's disease with bananas , sour milk and junket , Arch f Kinderh 84 144 , 1928 Following the death of Dr Haas in 1964 , there have been no controlled studies published of the SCD related to IBD One trial is ongoing http www rush edu rumc page 1298328953440 html Several books written by doctors and dietitians since 1998 mention or recommend this diet for specific conditions Hoffman , Ronald L \( 1997 \) Intelligent Medicine A Guide to Optimizing Health and Preventing Illness for the Baby Boomer Generation Fireside p 194 ISBN 0 684 81082 4 Lipman , Frank \( 2004 \) Total Renewal Tarcher p 98 ISBN 1 58542 384 X Ditchek , Stuart H \( 2009 \) Healthy Child , Whole Child Integrating the Best of Conventional and Alternative Medicine to Keep Your Kids Healthy Harper Paperbacks p 310 ISBN 0 06 168598 4 Dean , Carolyn \( 2001 \) Dr Carolyn Dean 's Natural Prescriptions for Common Ailments McGraw Hill 2 edition p 53 ISBN 0 658 01216 9 Theory The rationale of the diet , as described in Breaking the Vicious Cycle , is as follows When the body receives complex carbohydrates \( disaccharides or polysaccharides \) , these substances must be broken down before they can be absorbed In the body of a person who is not able to break these substances down efficiently , an influx of undigested material causes harmful bacteria to flourish Bacterial overgrowth is accordingly followed by a significant increase in the waste and other irritants they produce Irritation in the lining of the digestive tract results in the overproduction of mucus and injury to the digestive tract , which in turn causes malabsorption and makes it even more difficult to maintain proper digestion The purpose of the diet is to break the ongoing cycle caused by an overpopulation of harmful bacteria in the gut When the body is able to absorb the proper nutrients from simple sugars and other carbohydrates that are easy to digest , the inflammation and other complications caused by many autoimmune diseases can be lessened The goal is to rid the body of complex saccharides so the gut will be able to heal itself and enable further healing to occur The method of the diet is to keep the bacterial flora well balanced and to allow the gut to digest all of the food it is given , thereby starving out the harmful bacteria Certain foods , such as commercial syrups and sugars , starchy vegetables , and dairy products are not allowed while on the diet Other foods , such as fruits , greens , animal protein , and nuts , are allowed References External links '' Breaking the Vicious Cycle , Elaine Gottschall 's informational website on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet Media Articles BoingBoing article by Seth Roberts , Grandmother Knows Best About Crohn 's Disease Category Diets Category Autism fr R gime en glucides sp cifiques fi SCD
