thumb right 200px Eberhard duke of Friuli Notability Saint Evrard , Duke of Frioul and son in law of Louis le D bonaire , was one of the principal personages of the Carolingian period As his name belongs to a great history , our region could , in right name , be re vindicated as one of his glories Cysoing , above all , has the right to call itself Saint Evrard 's village The past of Saint Evrard and of the village of Cysoing are themselves intimately tied such that it is impossible to separate them One would excuse us for therefore reuniting them Saint Evrard Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing Son Culte Ses Reliques by Abbott Jules BATAILLE \( 1902 \) So reads the preface of an ecclesiastic work on Evrard and Cysoing There was a flurry of research and publishing associated with the discovery of Evrard 's body at Cysoing early in the twentieth century , mostly limited to Lille Roubaix and within elements of the Church Family He inherited the title of Duke of Friuli from his

II The Royal Ancestry Bible Royal Ancestors of 300 Colonial American Families by Michel L Call \( charts 1986 2022 \) His father was Berengar , the son of Count Unroch After other authors , Unroch , the grandfather of Saint Evrard , should have been the Duke of Frioul Alas , some have written that Saint Evrard had for his father Carloman I , the brother of Charlemagne His grandfather was , it is said , the Count Unroch who was leaving the court of Charlemagne and signatory to the will of the emperor Maternity theories His mother was Engeltron of Paris , a daughter of Begue , Count of Paris As for his mother , she was , Buzelin says , the daughter of Didier , king of the Lombards Education Saint Evrard lived in the ninth century He was born under the reign of Charlemagne and died under that of Charles the Bald Saint Evrard was elevated to the court of Charlemagne and of Louis the D bonaire He took his education at the Palace School founded by Charlemagne and organized by Alcuin , where he studied from the medieval programs known as the trivium and the quadrivium There he got a taste of the letters and sciences , at the same time that he developed his famous piety It is without doubt that it was at the Palace School that Saint Evrard began to build the rich library of which he enumerates the books with so much care in his will voir plus loin page 12Translator C'est sans doute l'Ecole du palais que saint Evrard commen a se composer cette riche biblioth que dont il num re les livres avec tant de soin dans son testament Warlike exploits and role as mediator under Louis le D bonaire As soon as his age permitted him to carry arms , Saint Evrard took part in numerous military expeditions Les Sires de Cysoing par Thierry Leuridan , p 14 Named Duke of Frioul and Count or MarquisLes Sires de Cysoing par Thierry Leuridan , p 14 Rerum gallicarum et francicarum scriptores usw de Tr vise , in Italy , he defended his country against invasion by the Bulgars and managed to completely drive these new barbarians from the peninsula 825 830 He rendered service unto Louis le D bonaire that was still more distinguished During the tragic years \( 830 839 \) where the emperor had suffered at the hand of his son 's revolt the most undignified treatment , Count Evrard remained inviolably loyal He exercised his influence in Lothair 's sphere \( the elder son of the emperor \) to bring about a reconciliation between father and son It is certain that it was on his council in 839 , that Lothaire went to Worms to implore the pardon of his father Les Sires de Cysoing par Thierry Leuridan Marriage and life at Cysoing In return for his services , the emperor Louis le D bonaire gave Count Evrard the highest honor possible the hand of his \( acknowledged \) daughter , the Princess Gis le , in marriage The Princess Gis le , a woman of piety and virtue , was the daughter of Louis le D bonaire and his second wife , the empress Judith Among the rich domains the Princess brought with her in her dowry , Count Evrard found the fisc of Cysoing One gives the name fisc , in this age , to large , rural properties separate from the royal domains that is , to sorts of farms with a residence for the master and homes for settlers Les sires de Cysoing par Thierry Leuridan p 11 The Royal Fisc of Cysoing , situated at the center of the country of P vele , was one of the most beautiful in the region The stay seemed so agreeable to Saint Evrard and the Princess Gis le that they made it one of their regular residences The castle which they inhabited was without doubt the same as that of the lords of Cysoing in following centuries It found itself part of a magnificent property , surrounded by water , that actually belongs to the family Bigo Vanderhagen The farming ditches were marked in the oldest documents Rapports de la baronnie de Cysoing 1392 , 1455 , 1595 Archives d partementales Etat g n ral 81 , 82 , 88 It is not rash to think these were dug in Saint Evrard 's time , or perhaps even earlier Already , in the century before \( in 752 \) , the little hamlet established on the royal fisc of Cysoing has been made famous through the martyrdom of Saint Arnoul Saint Arnoul , a courageous warrior , who was , it is said , the father of Godefroid , Bishop of Cambrai Arras , had been attached to the court of a noble lord , his relative His virtues and his merits were so radiant that God accorded his prayers more than one miracle during his life He became even more glorious through his martyrdom He was so devoted to his master that he eventually died for himActa sanctorum II p 971 Cartul de Cys p 768 , 905 , 914 , 919 thus attaining martyrdom Saint Arnoul was already honored at Cysoing when Saint Evrard and Princess Gis le went to take possession of their domain His relics were conserved there Cysoing , of this age , has therefore a church , or less a chapel that was without doubt the same chapel as the royal fisc Saint Evrard , at Cysoing , had a chaplain named Walgaire They \( Evrard and Gis le \) decided to found a monastery at Cysoing The project was long and difficult , and was not complete at the time of Evrard 's or Gis le 's deaths The monastery was initially made in honor of Saint Saveur and Mary \( mother of Jesus \) The religious lived there under canon law in a community with all the rigors of the cloister Their special function was singing solemnly in the church They maintained public prayer Saint Evrard was known to enjoy singing with the choir After his later campaigns in the defense of Italy , the remains of Pope Callixtus I were re interred in the Abbey at Cysoing Character Saint Evrard , himself , has organized his home in a way so perfectly that it was more like a monastery than a castle He was seconded in this task by his pious wife , Gis le , who dedicated herself to the education of their many children The poor and ill were sure of finding not only banal security at Cysoing , but also help and protection The social question of the time , that of serfs , also preoccupied Saint Evrard He had freed a good number In their testimony , he expressly refrained from impeding their liberty He never forgot those who he did n't free , and tried to improve their lots Though he was a courageous and formidable , he worked all his life for peace His private virtues were no less remarkable In his elevated position , he strove to preserve modesty and humility , to avoid splendor and arrogance His zeal for the glory of God , to spread the Truth , to convert the infidels , was celebrated throughout the Church Also , his piety , his taste for ceremonies of worship , his devotion to the saints , and his respect for the precious relics was apparent in his every act Pacifier Saint Evrard 's activity was not limited to the royal fisc of Cysoing , as he involved himself freely with matters of other domains and the empire in general Emperor Louis the Debonaire went to die \( 840 \) and the war , a cruel war without mercy , exploded between the Emperor Lothaire and his two brothers , Louis le Germanique and Charles the Bald Saint Evrard strongly deplored this fighting battling and fratricide and made all efforts to bring it to an end After the bloody battle of Fontenay \( 25 June 841 \) , he left the ambassadorial envoy of Lothaire near that of Lothaire 's brothers for peace negotiations The preparatory conference took place in 842 at Milin , near Ch lons in Champagne It was decided to divide the empire between the three brothers The negotiators , among which Evrard could be found , were charged with making the partitioning equitable fair It was not before August 843 that they presented their report to the three kings at Verdun Wars with the Saracens The negotiations ended and peace was re established between the three brothers , Saint Evrard left in haste for Italy Italy was under threat from African Saracens These Saracens had been named as helpers , in 842 , by the Duke of Benevento and they would soon become a threat to regimes throughout the peninsula They menaced Rome and pillaged it many times Saint Evrard , in his position as Duke of Friuli , was made a captain leader of the resistance The war wore on for several years and ended in 851 with the defeat of the Saracens Evrard has a reputation for being both a courageous soldier and able leader throughout these battles In the tradition of Charlemagne , Evrard forced the vanquished to convert to Christianity , meritoriously teaching them the Gospel , himself Testament and death Sometime after this solemnity , Eberhard returned to Italy We find him in 858 among the ambassadors who the emperor Louis le Jeune , son of Lothaire , sent to Ulm , near his uncle Louis le Germanique After this date , we know nothing more about Eberhard until his Testimony , a very interesting curious strange document , whose authenticity is certain and in which we are given information on the life of Eberhard This Testimony was made in Italy , at Musiestro Castle , in the county of Tr vise , in 867 Evrard and his consort meticulously recorded not only their lands and possessions within a prepared will , but the identities and relationships of family members and neighboring royals With the agreement of his spouse , Princess Gis le , Eberhard portioned his goods among his seven children The eldest , Unroch , got all properties in Lombardy and Germany The second , Berengar , got Annappes with its dependencies less Gruson and the other properties in the Hesbaye amongst which the small curtis Hildina that several writers identified as Hosden , an old independent seigneurie being nowadays the little hamlet Hosdent , of and in the Condroz The third , Ad lard , got the lands of Cysoing , Camphin , Gruson and Somain , with charges and respects of all the properties of the Abbey in these regions The fourth , Rodolphe , got Vitry en Artois and Mestucha , except for the church at Vitry which was given with the Abbey at Cysoing thumb right Cysoing 's first charter page 1 The three daughters of Eberhard , Ingletrude , Judith and Heilwich , got various other domains Ermen , Marshem , Balghingham , Heliwsheim , Hostrenheim , Luisinga , Wendossa , Engerresteim Eberhard had another daughter who carried the name of Gis le , her mother But she was dead at the time of his testimony The testimony split equally the jewels and ornaments of the saint , the precious objects of his chapel and the books of his library It is dated 867 , the 24th year of the reign of Lothaire 's son , Louis
