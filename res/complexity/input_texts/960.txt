Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria \( ROGD \) is a provisional label that has been used to characterize a new subgroup of adolescents , mainly biological females , who appear to have a developmental history leading to gender dysphoria that has not been previously described , according to Kenneth Zucker , professor of Psychiatry and Psychology at the University of Toronto and editor in chief of the Archives of Sexual Behavior The term is used to describe the phenomenon of people , usually younger people , who suddenly begin to report symptoms of gender dysphoria and begin to self identify as transgender after displaying no previous signs of gender identity uncertainty It has been suggested that rapid onset gender dysphoria could be a social coping mechanism for other disorders , such as depression and anxiety caused by adolescent trauma Following corrections issued by PLOS one , the sole peer reviewed study on the hypothesized phenomenon asserts that ROGD has not been clinically validated Publication controversy The term was first used by Lisa Littman , an American physician and researcher at the School of Public Health at Brown University at a 2017 conference , and then again in a 2018 paper published in the free online journal of science , PLOS One The publication of the paper led to controversy about both the methods used in the study and academic freedom once pressure from online activists led to a retraction of a press release by Brown University and an internal review from the journal After the review , a corrected version of the paper was published in March 2019 , reframing its goals , methodology , and conclusions According to the statement of correction , other than the addition of a few missing values in Table 13 , the Results section is unchanged in the updated version of the article The Competing Interests statement and the Data Availability statement have also been updated in the revised version Writing for PLOS , editor Joerg Heber wrote an apology , saying the study , including its goals , methodology , and conclusions , were not adequately framed in the published version , and that these needed to be corrected and that the hypothesized ROGD condition had not yet been clinically validated Controversy Aside from the controversy of the methods of the original papers and the academic freedoms around it , the alleged condition has been a source of heated discussion The phenomenon has been called both a poisonous lie used to discredit trans people in the op ed section of The Guardian , but also an explanation for the experiences of multiple parents writing in the op ed section of the Wall Street Journal and online support communities Publications have called ROGD anti trans , bad science and a conservative invention , whereas Madeleine Kearns a contributing writer at National Review has described the alleged condition as particularly concerning and called for further study , while also suggesting that activists are depriving the transgender community of their right to receive accurate information References Category Gender identity
