government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and its supporters , while his opponents maintain that the Patriarch abdicated following numerous protests against him by the faithful His attempt to reverse his abdication was refused by the Holy Synod of the Church which authorized a new Patriarchal election Abune Paulos was elected in 1992 , and Abune Merkorios and his supporters went into exile , establishing a rival synod in the United States The enthronement of Abune Paulos as Patriarch was fully recognized by all the canonical Orthodox Christian Churches , including the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria Patriarchate in Alexandria , Egypt During his office , much urban property that had been taken from the church was returned , most notably the return of the campus and the library of Holy Trinity Theological College , and the College was reopened Abuna Paulos built a new Patriarchal office and residence complex at the site of the old one , and reformed the bureaucracy of the Patriarchate He travelled widely , strengthening the ties of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church with other sister churches He reluctantly acquiesced to the breaking away of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church when that country declared independence Abune Paulos also took the initiative to the series of peace meetings between all Ethiopian and Eritrean religious leaders in 1998 , 1999 and 2000 in an effort to bring peace between the two countries in response to a bitterly fought border war Patriarch Abune Paulos and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church were extensively involved in the support of war displaced and drought hit Ethiopians , making the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church one of the major relief organizations in the country In 1995 , Abuna Paulos asked for the faithful to fulfill their religious obligations by contributing their share to the restoration of Holy Trinity Cathedral He led a Fundraising Committee of 15 people which was established to work within the country and abroad on the project The Patriarch continually championed the cause of the many victims of the Derg regime Patriarch Abune Paulos presided over the funerals of Emperor Haile Selassie in 2000 \( even in the face of government hostility to this event \) , Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen in 1997 , and Princess Tenagnework in 2004 He also presided over the funerals of the 60 ex officials of the Imperial government in 1993 , and the funeral of the leading opposition leader of the time , Professor Asrat Woldeyes in 1998 Abuna Paulos also found success after he asked a British Museum to return ten tabots containing images of the Ark of the covenant These carvings , supposedly so sacred that only ordained priests may look at them , were taken by British troops in 1868 during the rescue of the hostages imprisoned by the Emperor Tewdros Tabots from the British Museum In March 2006 , Abune Paulos was elected to serve as one of the seven presidents of the World Council of Churches , during its summit in Brazil On 13 July 2007 , Abune Paulos visited the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in Egypt , met with Pope Shenouda III of Egypt This visit re established the relationship between the Ethiopian and Coptic Church after time of separation Abune Paulos visited some of the Coptic associations in Egypt , and on 15 July , he visited a Coptic Egyptian Church named after an Ethiopian Saint Tekle Haymanot Coptic Orthodox Church in Alexandria , Egypt Abune Paulos implemented a proposal to build a University in Entoto that would help to commemorate the millennium according to the Ethiopian calendar This University is intended to be a study and research center in Entoto Debre Hayl Saint Raguel Church The Holy Synod and Abune Paulos appealed for the faithful to protect church heritages with a view to enabling them to be transferred to the next generation An act of Abune Paulos that caused much controversy was his advocacy of a pardon for the members of the Derg regime imprisoned in Ethiopia The members of the Derg had asked the Patriarch to facilitate an opportunity for them to appear in the national press to ask for forgiveness from the people of Ethiopia for the errors and atrocities of their regime The Patriarch approached the government with the idea that as the now aging members of the former communist junta were contrite and seeking forgiveness , the government should grant them clemency On 1 June 2011 , President Girma Wolde Giorgis of Ethiopia announced that the death sentences imposed on the top Derg members had been commuted to life sentences As under Ethiopian law , a life sentence is equated to 25 years , both those previously sentenced to death and those imprisoned for life and lesser sentences were all immediately freed This act immediately caused significant uproar among many of the survivors of Derg imprisonment , the family members of those killed during Derg rule and other opponents of Derg rule The organization of survivors of victims of the Red Terror voiced their opposition and sent a letter of protest to the Patriarch Members of the families of the 60 ex officials of Emperor Haile Selassie 's government executed without trial on November 23 , 1974 , as well as some members of the Imperial family met with Abune Paulos as well to make their views known They believed that a commutation of death sentences to life imprisonment was not as objectionable , but that the release of people responsible for mass killings , torture , imprisonment without trial , and gross abuse of power was a great injustice The Patriarch counseled these groups that it was the duty of Christians to forgive , especially those who voiced contrition The groups opposed to the Derg pardon came away from the incident blaming Abune Paulos , but certain prominent members of the group , such as Mulugeta Aserate \( son of Prince Aserate Kassa who was executed with the 60 ex officials on 23 November 1974 \) wrote articles supporting the Patriarch 's promotion of forgiveness and national reconciliation , and applauded the pardon His ecumenical trip to India to meet Baselios Thoma Didymos I , Catholicos of the East in December 2008 , strengthened the communion of Ethiopian and Indian Orthodox Churches On 26 June 2009 , the Italian press claimed that Abune Paulos along with a man claiming to be a son of the late Prince Makonnen , Duke of Harar and Duke Amedeo of Aosta , would come forward at the Hotel Aldrovandi in Rome with the announcement that the true Ark of the Covenant , which has supposedly been kept in secret at St Mary 's of Zion in Ethiopia , would be unveiled to the public to view for the first time in history in a museum being built in Axum The announcement was never made instead the Patriarch immediately denied that any such event had ever been planned The person that the Italian press had identified as the Ethiopian Prince was subsequently revealed as not being a recognized member of the former Imperial family , but rather a person claiming to be the illegitimate son of the late prince The involvement of the Duke of Aosta in the affair was also called into question The cornerstone for a museum at Axum was indeed laid by Patriarch Abune Paulos , but there are no plans to display or house the Ark of the Covenant there His attitude towards homosexual Ethiopians remains orthodox In December 2008 , he was one of nearly a dozen Ethiopian religious figures \( including the leader of Ethiopian Muslim Majlis Council and the heads of the Protestant and Catholic churches \) who adopted a resolution against homosexuality , urging Ethiopian lawmakers to endorse a ban on homosexual activity in the constitution The religious figures attributed a rise in sexual attacks on children and young men to the vice of homosexuality Abuna Paulos went on to say , This is something very strange in Ethiopia , the land of the Bible that condemns this very strongly For people to act in this manner they have to be dumb , stupid like animals We strongly condemn this behaviour They \( homosexuals \) have to be disciplined and their acts discriminated , they have to be given a lesson Death Abune Paulos died in Addis Ababa on 16 August 2012 The foreign ministry reported that he had been receiving treatment over the past week for an undisclosed illness An opposition website , Ethiopian Review , reported that he had died of a heart attack Lij Mulugeta Aserate Kassa , an adviser at the Ethiopian embassy in the United Kingdom , and

Balcha Hospital , according to an independent Orthodox website , Deje Selam , where he died early in the following morning Although Lij Mulugeta said that he could not confirm the cause of death ,
