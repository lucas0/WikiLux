of hope who guaranteed peaceful coexistence with neighboring nations , integration to Europe and the rest of the world , economic prosperity and a brighter future He appealed to people in Serbia whose goal is for their country to join the West , to join the European Union , and to become normal Europeans with normal lives Unlike Vojislav Ko tunica , who openly expressed opposition at times to the West in i and Ko tunica realised that they both needed each other for their respective goals Ko tunica believed that Serbia needed to join the West so that it could keep Kosovo and so that Republika Srpska could be maintained Vojislav Ko tunica , who served as in i 's political opponent and critic during his premiership , and today is even assumed as possibly involved in creation of atmosphere

his energy and commitment made it possible for things to move forward It is one thing to watch it from the sidelines and it is completely different to be a part of it I understand that now when I am Prime Minister and watch things a bit differently He was very important for the whole process Following his death , a small but influential movement emerged throughout Serbia and the Serbian diaspora organized around a short documentary about Zoran in i \( created by Belgrade director Aleksandar Mandi \) The documentary Ako Srbija Stane \( If Serbia Comes to A Standstill \) was a collection of edited speeches given by in i on a speaking tour in Serbia shortly before his death A movement called Kapiraj created a network of students and other young people who were committed to copying and distributing the documentary free of charge This campaign was known by the slogan Kapiraj kopiraj \( which means Catch on and Copy in Serbian \) and its purpose was to have a non party initiative to have as many people as possible hear in i 's message , to put an end to the fleeing from responsibility , and to do the most for oneself so that Serbia does not stop The documentary has mobilized many people , partly because of its powerful ending after a series of dynamic , sharp and energetic speeches , the film ends with a freeze frame of in i which slowly fades to black as a gentle piano piece signifies his death The freeze frame interrupts in i in the middle of a sentence in which he is about to warn his audience that This is our last chance If Serbia stops now The documentary is available at YouTube In May 2008 , ICTY imprisioned Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj compared Dindic s assassin with Archduke Franz Ferdinand assassin , saying he would enjoy the same fame and glory that Gavrilo Princip has in Serbian history e elj in i killer merits same glory as Princip , B92 , 21 May 2008 Quotes If someone believes they can stop the implementation of the law by eliminating me , they are seriously deluding themselves , because I am not the system The system will continue to function , and no one will receive amnesty for their crimes by eliminating one or two government
