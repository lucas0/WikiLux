Biolinguistics is the study of the biology and evolution of language It is a highly interdisciplinary field , including linguists , biologists , neuroscientists , psychologists , mathematicians , and others By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces natural sciences , it seeks to yield a framework by which we can understand the fundamentals of the faculty of language Origins The biolinguistic perspective began to take shape in the mid twentieth century , among the linguists influenced by the developments in biology and mathematics Chomsky , Noam 2004 Biolinguistics and the Human Capacity Lecture delivereat MTA , Budapest , May 17 http www chomsky info talks 20040517 htm Eric Lenneberg s Biological Foundations of Language remains a basic document of the field Lenneberg , Eric 1967 Biological Foundations of Language New York John Wiley Sons , Inc In 1974 , the first Biolinguistic conference was organized by Massimo Piattelli Palmarini , bringing together evolutionary biologists , neuroscientists , linguists , and others interested in the development of language in the individual , its origins , and evolution Boeckx , Cedric and Massimo Piattelli Palmarini \( in print \) Language as a natural object , linguistics as a natural science Developments Recent work in theoretical linguistics and cognitive studies at MIT construes human language as a highly non redundant species specific system Noam Chomsky s latest contribution to the study of the mind in general and language in particular is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the Minimalist Program In syntax , lexical items are merged externally , building argument representations next , the internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings If this is true , then the objective of biolinguists is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental recursion Hypothesis It is possible that the core principles of the language faculty can be correlated to natural laws \( such as for example , the Fibonacci sequence an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it , see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005 \) Soschen , Alona 2006 Natural Law The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in the Minimalist Program DEAL Linguistics in Potsdam 25 http www ling uni potsdam de lip 25 LIP25 3soschen pdf According to the hypothesis being developed , the essential properties of language arise from nature itself the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere , from the pattern of petals in flowers , leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body If this law applies to existing systems of cognition , both in humans and non humans , then what allows our mind to create language \? Could it be that a single cycle exists , a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences , refer to ourselves and other persons , group objects and establish relations between them , and eventually understand each other \? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough , not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general Critiques David Poeppel , a neuroscientist and linguist , has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong , there is a risk of inter disciplinary cross sterilization , arguing that there is a Granularity Mismatch Problem , as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components Poeppel and Embick also introduce the Ontological Incommensurability Problem , where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes Poeppel suggests that neurolinguistic research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation People in biolinguistics Massimo Piatelli Palmarini , University of Arizona Cedric Boeckx , ICREA , University of Barcelona David Poeppel , University of Maryland W Tecumseh Fitch , University of Vienna Marc D Hauser , Harvard University Philip Lieberman , Brown University Derek Bickerton , University of Hawaii Kenneth Wexler , MIT Ray C Dougherty , New York University \( NYU \) Alec Marantz , NYU MIT Andrew Carnie University of Arizona Charles Reiss , Concordia University Michael Arbib , University of Southern California Alona Soschen , MIT See also Biosemiotics Evolutionary psychology of language Neurolinguistics Origin of language References Conferences Biolinguistic Investigations Conference , Santo Domingo , Dominican Republic , February 2007 http www biolinguistics net Conference on Biolinguistics Language Evolution and Variation , Universit di Venezia , June 2007 http www biolinguistics uqam ca ICREA International Symposium in Biolinguistics , Universitat de Barcelona , October 2012 http stel ub edu symposium The Journal of Biolinguistics http www biolinguistics eu External links Biolinguistics Journal Category Syntax Category Noam Chomsky Category Linguistics Category Cognitive science
