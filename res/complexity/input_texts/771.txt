From Darwin to Hitler evolutionary ethics , eugenics , and racism in Germany is a 2004 book by Richard Weikart , a historian at California State University , Stanislaus , and a senior fellow for the Center for Science and Culture of the Discovery Institute The work is controversial For example , Peter Bowler described it as Richard Weikart 's controversial book From Darwin to Hitler Evolutionary Ethics , Eugenics , and Racism in Germany in Graeme Gooday , John M Lynch , Kenneth G Wilson , and Constance K Barsky wrote that numerous reviews have accused Weikart of selectively viewing his rich primary material , ignoring political , social , psychological , and economic factors that helped shape Nazi eugenics and racism Graeme Gooday , John M Lynch , Kenneth G Wilson , and Constance K Barsky Background and summary The Discovery Institute , the hub of the intelligent design movement , provided crucial funding for the book 's research Many thanks also to the Center for Science and Culture \( especially Jay Richards and Steve Meyer \) , which provided crucial funding and much encouragement From Darwin to Hitler , Richard Weikart , page x The Institute operates DarwinToHitler com , which promotes the book and intelligent design Prominent historian and critic of the intelligent design movement , Barbara Forest , states that the book is tied to the DI 's 'wedge strategy' of attacking Darwinian science as morally corrupting Barbara Forrest and Paul R Gross Creationism 's Trojan Horse The Wedge of Intelligent Design 2004 , page 206 This strategy aims to defeat the materialist world view represented by the theory of evolution in favor of a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions Weikart has appeared in creationist films promoting the book In 2006 , Weikart appeared in Coral Ridge Ministries' creationist film Darwin 's Deadly Legacy in which Weikart claims Darwinian ideology is the core of Nazism and D James Kennedy concludes To put it simply , no Darwin , no Hitler In 2008 , Weikart , a supporter of intelligent design , also appeared in Expelled No Intelligence Allowed , a pro intelligent design movie , which among other claims , strongly implies that Charles Darwin 's ideas led to Adolf Hitler 's atrocities Bret Carroll , Weikart 's colleague in the Stanislaus history department , wrote That 'intelligent design' is not a scientific theory and the Expelled movie misuses Weikart 's research by mistakenly implying that Darwin led inevitably to Hitler In fact , scientific theories , even those like Darwin 's that address organic life , are morally neutral In the conclusion of From Darwin to Hitler , Weikart writes Academic reception Negative evaluations by academic reviewers are critical of the book citing Weikart 's selective use of primary sources and ignoring a range of developments that shaped Nazi ideology In 2004 , Sander Gliboff , professor of History and Philosophy of Science at Indiana University , criticized the work writing that It is dismaying to see such opinions being passed off as results of scholarly research In 2005 , Andrew Zimmerman , a professor of German history , reviewed it in the American Historical Review , writing Weikart presents an image of Darwinism at once both too narrow and too broad Zimmerman wrote Weikart replied to Zimmerman 's criticism with a letter to the editor 1323 to which Zimmerman offered a rebuttal saying Weikart 's work is anachronistic , projecting present day theocratic agendas onto the history of science in Imperial Germany 1323 Nils Roll Hansen , historian and philosopher of 19th and 20th century biology at University of Oslo , also reviewed the work in 2005 and was critical of it in a review published by Isis calling it selective and containing insufficient attention to historical change leaving out political , social , and economic factors as well as the role of new knowledge in genetics make his overall argument unconvincing Jonathan Judaken , professor of History at University of Memphis , wrote that while it is a significant study , he fails to follow the rich nuances of the discourse practices and institutions that have preoccupied the contemporary generation of intellectual historians , who have paid attention to the continuities and ruptures within systems of thought So his presentation of racism , for example , reiterates a rationale that does not stand up to the critical scrutiny of intellectual history Larry Arnhart , a professor of Political Science at Northern Illinois University wrote Weikart does n't actually show any direct connection between Darwin and Hitler In fact , Weikart has responded to my criticisms by admitting that the title of his book is misleading , since he cannot show any direct link between Darwin 's ideas and Hitler 's Nazism Arnhart wrote Weikart repeatedly admits that there is no direct connection between Darwin and Hitler In contrast , Arnhart wrote If one is looking for a good German source for anti Semitism , one obvious one would be Martin Luther 's virulent writing attacking the Jews , which was often invokved by the Nazis But Weikart never mentions Luther because this would weaken his argument that Christianity promoted the equal dignity of all human beings against the degrading materialism of Darwinism in Larry Arnhart , Darwinian Conservatism A Disputed Question \( Charlottesville Imprint Academic , 2005 \) , p 114 ISBN 0 907845 99 1 Also in 2005 , science historian Paul Lawrence Farber wrote in the Journal of the History of Biology that Like other attempts to tar Darwin with all of the problems of modernity , Weikart 's suffers from conceptual flaws that detract from his book , which contains some interesting material on the German eugenics movement , popular Darwinism in Germany , and German evolutionary ethics He concluded Weikart 's book , unfortunately , is likely to spawn more urban myths about Darwin that will have to be addressed In 2006 , Robert J Richards , historian of Darwin and eugenics at University of Chicago , wrote It can only be a tendentious and dogmatically driven assessment that would condemn Darwin for the crimes of the Nazis Published as The Moral Grammar of Narratives in History of Biology The Case of Haeckel and Nazi Biology in The Cambridge Companion to the Philosophy of Biology ed David L Hull \( Cambridge Cambridge University Press , 2007 \) pp 429 452 ISBN 9780521616713 Richards more pointedly concluded Hitler was not a Darwinian and calls this all a desperate tactic to undermine evolution Richards explained , There 's not the slightest shred of evidence that Hitler read Darwin , and Some of the biggest influences on Hitler 's anti Semitism were opposed to evolution , such as British writer Houston Stewart Chamberlain , whose racial theory became incorporated into Nazi doctrine Similarly , historian Marius Turda 's review asks why Weikart 's book did not focus on some authors who actually are credited with influencing Hitler , such as J rg Lanz von Liebenfels , the Viennese Aryan racist who formulated the doctrine of Ariosophy , or Guido von List , another Viennese occult racist , or Josef Reimer , author of A Pan German Germany \( 1905 \) \( whom Weikart discusses cursorily \) Also in a review that same year Helmut Walser Smith of Vanderbilt University writes that the book 's larger argument remains too narrowly conceived , as elements of Nazism , including nationalism and anti Sermitism make cameo appearances , for example , but their power is hardly gauged He concludes saying it is a thesis on a tight rope , which is convincing as long as one does not look down In 2006 , Ann Taylor Allen , a professor of German history at the University of Louisville , reviewed Weikart 's book for The Journal of Modern History She explained that Weikart 's talk about Darwinism is not based on any careful reading of Darwin himself but on vague ideas by a variety of people who presented themselves as Darwinian Moreover , fundamental elements of Nazism like anti Semitism cannot be attributed to Darwinism since they predate evolutionary theory Allen concluded In 2007 , Hector Avalos , a professor of Religious Studies and founder of Iowa State University 's Atheist and Agnostic Society , Iowa State Daily wrote an essay for the anti Creationism site Talk reason with the purpose of exposing the historical flaws found in the work of Weikart and argued that the defense of genocide , infanticide and eugenics by creationists actually has a very venerable and lengthy tradition that precedes Darwin In a May 2008 debate with Weikart , Avalos criticized Weikart 's quoting of Darwin Listen at 29 minute mark Weikart states in his book Avalos said that the quote is often misrepresented in creationist literature , and that Darwin was reporting and criticizing the extermination of people at a time of colonial expansion , rather than promoting it Darwin 's passage , in full context , reads In 2009 , historian Peter J Bowler of Queen 's University wrote in Notes and Records of the Royal Society that Weikart 's book reflects a simple blame game in which \( for example \) Darwin and Haeckel are accused of paving the way for Nazism , and criticized him and others for associating Darwin with distasteful social policies using a remarkably simple minded approach Weikart has posted responses to four reviews on his webpage Besides criticisms from historians , Weikart was criticized by Jeff Schloss , professor at Westmont College and former Discovery Institute fellow , in the Christian American Scientific Affiliation 's publication regarding the Expelled film Schloss wrote that the ideas that are attributed to Darwin \( such as natural selection makes might right in social policy \) were actually not advocated but repudiated by Darwin and his immediate colleagues Weikart wrote a response The reception has not been universally negative Ian Dowbiggin , a Catholic opponent of euthanasia who teaches at the University of Prince Edward Island , found some value in it and has used this work as a source See also Reductio ad Hitlerum Godwin 's
