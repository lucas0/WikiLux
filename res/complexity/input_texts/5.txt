thumb Mother Teresa at a pro life meeting in 1986 in Bonn , West Germany The work of Catholic nun and missionary Anjez Gonxhe Bojaxhiu , commonly known as Mother Teresa , received mixed reactions from prominent people , governments and organizations Her practices and those of the Missionaries of Charity , the order which she founded , were subject to numerous controversies These include objections to the quality of medical care which they provided , suggestions that some deathbed baptisms constituted forced conversion , and alleged links to colonialism and racism Mother Teresa received extensive media coverage , and some critics suggest that the Church used her image to promote Catholicism and divert the public 's attention from ecclesiastical scandals Media criticisms Indian author and physician Aroup Chatterjee , who briefly worked in one of Mother Teresa 's homes , investigated the financial practices and other practices of Teresa 's order In 1994 , two British journalists , Christopher Hitchens and Tariq Ali , produced a critical British Channel 4 documentary , Hell 's Angel , based on Chatterjee 's work The next year , Hitchens published The Missionary Position Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice , a book that repeated many of the accusations in the documentary Chatterjee published The Final Verdict in 2003 , a less polemical work than those of Hitchens and Ali , but equally critical of Teresa 's operations In 2003 , after Teresa was beatified by John Paul II , Hitchens continued his criticism , calling her a fanatic , a fundamentalist , and a fraud He further criticized the Catholic Church for ignoring the testimony of Dr Ranjan Mustafi who attributed the recovery of his patient to modern medicine , rather than a miracle associated with Mother Teresa Chatterjee and Hitchens were called by the Vatican to present evidence against Teresa during her canonisation process In 2016 , American sociologist , activist , and president of the Catholic League Bill Donohue wrote a book length response to criticism of Mother Teresa Quality of medical care In 1991 , Robin Fox , editor of the British medical journal The Lancet visited the Home for Dying Destitutes in Calcutta \( now Kolkata \) and described the medical care the patients received as haphazard He observed that sisters and volunteers , some of whom had no medical knowledge , had to make decisions about patient care because of the lack of doctors in the hospice Fox specifically held Teresa responsible for conditions in this home , and observed that her order did not distinguish between curable and incurable patients , so that people who could otherwise survive would be at risk of dying from infections and lack of treatment Fox conceded that the regimen he observed included cleanliness , the tending of wounds and sores , and kindness , but he noted that the sisters' approach to managing pain was disturbingly lacking The formulary at the facility Fox visited lacked strong analgesics which he felt clearly separated Mother Teresa 's approach from the hospice movement Fox also wrote that needles were rinsed with warm water , which left them inadequately sterilised , and that the facility did not isolate patients with tuberculosis There have been a series of other reports documenting inattention to medical care in the order 's facilities Similar points of view have also been expressed by some former volunteers who worked for Teresa 's order Mother Teresa herself referred to the facilities as Houses of the Dying cf Mother Teresa 's care for the dying , letters from David Jeffrey , Joseph O'Neill and Gilly Burns , The Lancet 344 \( 8929 \) 1098 In 2013 , in a comprehensive review covering 96 of the literature on Mother Teresa , a group of Universit de Montr al academics reinforced the foregoing criticism , detailing , among other issues , the missionary 's practice of caring for the sick by glorifying their suffering instead of relieving it , her questionable political contacts , her suspicious management of the enormous sums of money she received , and her overly dogmatic views regarding , in particular , abortion , contraception , and divorce Questioning the Vatican 's motivations for ignoring the mass of criticism , the study concluded that Mother Teresa 's hallowed image which does not stand up to analysis of the facts was constructed , and that her beatification was orchestrated by an effective media relations campaign engineered by the Catholic convert and anti abortion BBC journalist Malcolm Muggeridge Baptisms of the dying According to Christopher Hitchens , Mother Teresa encouraged members of her order to secretly baptise dying patients , without regard to the individual 's religion Susan Shields , a former member of the Missionaries of Charity , writes that Sisters were to ask each person in danger of death if he wanted a 'ticket to heaven' An affirmative reply was to mean consent to baptism The sister was then to pretend that she was just cooling the patient 's head with a wet cloth , while in fact she was baptising him , saying quietly the necessary words Secrecy was important so that it would not come to be known that Mother Teresa 's sisters were baptising Hindus and Muslims Murray Kempton has argued that patients were not provided sufficient information to make an informed decision about whether they wanted to be baptised and the theological significance of a Christian baptism Simon Leys , defending the practice in a letter to the New York Review of Books , argued that forced conversion is either benevolent or morally neutral Relationships with controversial public figures In Hell 's Angel and The Missionary Position , Hitchens leveled criticism at what he perceived to be Mother Teresa 's endorsement of the government of Enver Hoxha in Socialist Albania She visited Albania in August 1989 , where she was received by Hoxha 's widow , Nexhmije , Foreign Minister Reis Malile , the Minister of Health , Ahmet Kamberi , the Chairman of the People 's Assembly Petro Dode , and other state and party officials She subsequently laid a bouquet on Hoxha 's grave , and placed a wreath on the statue of Mother Albania She accepted money from the British publisher Robert Maxwell , who , as was later revealed , embezzled UK 450 million from his employees' pension funds There is no suggestion that she was aware of any theft before accepting the donation in either case Criticism does focus on Teresa 's character statement produced in the Charles Keating case , where Keating was charged with fraud following high profile business failures Keating had donated millions of dollars to Mother Teresa and had lent her his private jet when she visited the United States Keating 's convictions were thrown out on appeal , as was a summary judgement Keating later pled guilty to four counts of wire and bankruptcy fraud and was sentenced to time served After Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi 's suspension of civil liberties in 1975 \( The Emergency \) , Mother Teresa said People are happier There are more jobs There are no strikes These approving comments were seen as a result of the friendship between Teresa and the Congress Party Mother Teresa 's comments were even criticised outside India within the Catholic media She supported Licio Gelli 's nomination for the Nobel Prize in Literature Gelli was known for being the head of the Propaganda Due masonic lodge , which was implicated in various murders and high profile corruption cases in Italy , as well as having close connections with the neo fascist Italian Social Movement and the Argentine Military Junta In 2017 , investigative journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi , in a book titled Original Sin published accounting documents from the controversial Vatican Bank officially known as the Institute for the Works of Religion , which revealed that the funds which were held in Mother Theresa 's name on behalf of her charity had made her the Bank 's biggest client , and they amounted to billions Had she made substantial withdrawals , the Bank would have risked default Gianluigi Nuzzi Peccato Originale

activities Chatterjee stated that the public image of Mother Teresa as a helper of the poor was misleading , and that only a few hundred people are served by even the largest of the homes In 1998 , among the 200 charitable assistance organisations reported to operate in Calcutta , Missionaries of Charity was not ranked among the largest charity organisations with the Assembly of God charity notably serving a greater number of the poor at 18 , 000 meals daily translated source Chatterjee stated that many operations of the order engage in no charitable activity at all but instead use their funds for missionary work He stated , for example , that none of the eight facilities that the Missionaries of Charity run in Papua New Guinea have any residents in them , being purely for the purpose of converting local people to Catholicism She was sometimes accused by Hindus in her adopted country of trying to convert the poor to Catholicism by stealth 1997 Mother Teresa dies , BBC On This Day , 5 September 2008 Christopher Hitchens described Mother Teresa 's organisation as a cult that promoted suffering and did not help those in need He said that Mother Teresa 's own words on poverty proved that her intention was not to help people , quoting her words at a 1981 press conference in which she was asked Do you teach the poor to endure their lot \? She replied I think it is very beautiful for the poor to accept their lot , to share it with the passion of Christ I think the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people Relationship to colonialism and racism Australian feminist Germaine Greer called her a religious imperialist who preyed on the most vulnerable in the name of harvesting souls for Jesus In an essay in the collection White Women in Racialized Spaces , historian Vijay Prashad said of Mother Teresa Posthumous criticisms Mother Teresa died in 1997 Despite her request that all of her writings and correspondences be destroyed , a collection of them was posthumously released to the public in book form Her writings revealed that she struggled with feelings of disconnectedness , that were in contrast to the strong feelings which she had experienced as a young novice In her letters Mother Teresa describes a decades long sense of feeling disconnected from God and lacking the earlier zeal that had characterized her efforts to start the Missionaries of Charity As a result of this , she was judged by some to have ceased to believe and was posthumously criticized for hypocrisy Thomas C Reeves suggests that this criticism displays a basic unfamiliarity with the concept of the dark night of the soul Reeves , Thomas C , Mother Teresa 's Critics Undone , The Catholic League , September 20 2016 Holier than Thou , the May 23 , 2005 episode of the Showtime program Penn Teller Bullshit !
