thumb The current flag of the NPA thumb One of the NPA 's older flags The New People 's Army \( NPA \) \( \) is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines \( CPP \) It was formed and founded by Jose Maria Sison , Bernabe Buscayno , and Lucio Manlapaz on 29 March 1969 The Maoist NPA conducts its armed guerrilla struggle based on the strategical line of protracted people 's war With an estimated strength of nearly 3 , 200 militants in 2015 , and latest attack as recent as 2015 in Agusan Del Sur , it operates in the rural areas throughout Philippines especially in the inaccessible hill areas of provinces far from the major cities The NPA extorts taxes , mostly from businesses , in the areas where it operates The CPP refers to the NPA as the tax enforcement agency of the people 's revolutionary government Revolutionary taxes are used to fund community services and never go to the pockets of corrupt leaders said National Democratic Front \( NDF \) spokesperson , Fidel Agcaoili Peace negotiations have reached an impasse The Philippine government has specifically drafted a new framework which seeks to end the 27 year long stalemate in the talks , hoping to build ground with the leftist terrorists that is more comprehensive than human rights , the only issue on which the negotiating parties agree The NDF wants the Comprehensive Agreement on Socio Economic Reforms \( CASER \) signed first before the bilateral ceasefire agreement , or both can be signed simultaneously However , relations with the government soured in 2017 President Rodrigo Duterte officially designated the group as a terrorist organization in late 2017 Both the United States and the European Union had designated the NPA as a terrorist organization prior to the Duterte government History The New People 's Army originated due to a division within the Philippine Communist Party \( PKP \) in the latter half of the 1960s The split revolved around ideological and generational differences with the younger , more educated , and less orthodox members at odds with the entrenched , established , and old school founders These dissenters were drawn to the revolutions that were happening in Cuba and China Attempts at reconciliation between the two factions within the communist party failed , and the tensions were exacerbated by the foreign conflict between the Chinese Communist Party and the Soviet Communist Party Thus , the Communist Party of the Philippines \( CPP \) was established The international communist conflict between China and Russia continued to play a part in the party break up with China siding with the Communist Party of the Philippines This in turn made the Philippine Communist Party gravitate towards the Soviet Communist Party The CPP 's relationship with China continued for around seven years with ideas , rhetoric , visits , and aid flowing back and forth In the beginning of the CPP and NPA , they were supported heavily by the Chinese government , but their relations worsened when the Philippines and China established formal diplomatic relations The Chinese could no longer supply the rebels without extreme diplomatic backlash After the communist regime in China withdrew its support , the NPA were hard pressed to obtain materials , goods , arms , and funds To obtain weapons , the NPA initiated armed conflicts in order to obtain weapons and ammunition from government forces They became entirely self sustained through a variety of methods , the main being the levying of revolutionary taxes on regions throughout the Philippines This involved requesting populations and industries support the revolution with gifts of goods and funds Conflict between the NPA and the populace became common , and the population sometimes turned to cultist fanatics to guard against the NPA seizing their goods Kowalewski , David 1991 Cultism , insurgency , and vigilantism in the Philippines Sociological Analysis , 52 \( 3 \) , 241 253 Immediately after splitting from PKP , the CPP began to marshal its own forces Leaders of the CPP contacted Bernabe Buscayno , popularly known as Commander Dante , and his band of Huk guerrilla fighters Commander Dante became enamored with the ideology and goals of the CPP , so he accepted the party 's take over and use of his unit for their political purposes The combining of the Huk guerrillas and the CPP led to the rise of the New People 's Army on March 29 , 1969 This organization began conducting missions and operations on the Island of Luzon , and , in the early 1970s , the NPA 's ranks burgeoned from a few hundred to thousands of militants With their increased numbers , the NPA began engaging government forces more and more , but the government forces inflicted heavy losses on the NPA After forcing the NPA back , government leaders in Manilla decided to turn their attention to the Moro rebellion which allowed the NPA to recover from its near annihilation After this , the leaders of the CPP sought to change their strategy Up until that point , they had tried to use Mao 's tactic of consolidating their control in a region that was easily defended the mountains in the center of Luzon Their new strategy split the NPA and sent different contingents to other islands This way they organization became a many headed beast that could continue to harass the government over a wide area even while sustaining losses in one area Following this new paradigm , confrontations with the government increased in the late 1970s The NPA claims responsibility for the 1989 assassination of U S Army Colonel James Nick Rowe , founder of the U S Army Survival , Evasion , Resistance and Escape \( SERE \) course Colonel Rowe was part of a military assistance program to the Philippine Army The NPA asserts that this made him a legitimate military target Second Great Rectification Movement In the 1990s internal criticism about mistakes in the 1980s led to the Second Great Rectification Movement , launched in 1992 and largely completed in 1998 , leading to a resurgence in the Philippine insurgency The Second Rectification ended internal purges of the movement that killed hundreds of members on allegations of being deep penetration agents of the Armed Forces of the Philippines \( AFP \) and the Philippine intelligence community Former CPP and NPA cadre Lualhati Milan Abreu 's award winning memoir Agaw Dilim Agaw Liwanag chronicled the executions Despite its successes , the Second Great Rectification also resulted in a series of splits within the CPP and the NPA The Alex Boncayao Brigade , notorious for targeting policemen and officials that were allegedly corrupt , left the party , while some ended up forming groups such as the Revolutionary Proletarian Army and the Rebolusyonaryong Hukbong Bayan This group was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States in August 2002 and by the European Union in November 2005 The NPA 's
