North Lawndale , known to residents as simply Lawndale , is located on the West Side of Chicago , Illinois It is one of the well defined community areas in the city of Chicago History Once part of Cicero Township in 1869 , the eastern section of North Lawndale to Pulaski Road was annexed to Chicago by an act of the state legislature Thereafter , streets were platted and drainage ditches were installed between Western \( 2400 west \) and Pulaski Road \( 4000 west \) The name Lawndale was supplied by Millard and Decker , a real estate firm which subdivided the area in 1870 In 1871 , after the Great Chicago Fire , the McCormick Reaper Company \( later International Harvester \) constructed and occupied a new large plant in the South Lawndale neighborhood As a result , many plant workers moved to eastern North Lawndale The remaining area west of Crawford Avenue was annexed in 1889 by a resolution of the Cook County Commissioners By 1890 North Lawndale was beginning to be heavily populated by Bohemian immigrants from the Austro Hungarian Empire The section most populated by the Czechs was the area from Crawford \( Pulaski \) west , and from 12th St \( Roosevelt Rd \) to 16th St Real estate firm W A Merigold Co was the chief developer of that part of the community , which resulted in the name Merigold being associated with the neighborhood Czech institutions popped up in Merigold , beginning in 1890 with the Slovanska Lipa Sokol Tabor \( Czech fraternal gymnastic organization \) at 13th Karlov In 1892 the Bohemian Catholic Church , Our Lady of Lourdes , was established at the corner of 15th Keeler In 1909 the Czech Freethinkers School , Frantisek Palacky , was built at 1525 S Kedvale The Merigold neighborhood was also known as Novy Tabor \( New Camp \) by the Czech immigrants who settled there The premier Czech institution , established in 1912 , was the Ceska Beseda \( Bohemian Club \) at 3659 W Douglas Blvd This club was attended by Chicago 's Czech elite , as well as the visiting Czech elite of the rest of the United States and Czechoslovakia It was the place for its members to celebrate and enjoy literature , drama , and music by the most renowned and talented Czech artists The ethnic Bohemians spread throughout the rest of the North Lawndale neighborhood they were the original owners of many of the beautiful greystone buildings that graced the picturesque streets of the neighborhood Many of the elite members of the Bohemian community resided in the vicinity of the 1800 and 1900 blocks of South Millard Avenue These wealthy men , as well as the rest of the Czech residents of North Lawndale , were strongly committed to their neighborhood , and were involved in civic affairs Anton Dvorak Public Elementary School at 3615 W 16th St was named after the revered 19th century Czech composer Anton n Dvo k Several members of the North Lawndale Czech community occupied positions in city as well as county government In the post World War I years , the Czechs began leaving the neighborhood for newer housing in the western suburbs of Cicero , Berwyn , Riverside , and Brookfield By the 1920s many of the Czechs were gone , and Jews became the majority ethnic group of the neighborhood after having left the crowded confines of the Maxwell Street ghetto North Lawndale later became known as being the largest Jewish settlement in the City of Chicago , with 25 of the city 's Jewish population Steans Family Foundation , Chicago , 2009 Retrieved on 2010 05 11 From about 1918 to 1955 , Jews , overwhelmingly of Russian and Eastern European origin , dominated the neighborhood , starting in North Lawndale and moving northward as they became more prosperous In the 1950s , blacks migrated into the area from the South Side and from

1970s , Western Electric in the 1980s By 1970 African Americans who could also left North Lawndale , beginning a precipitous population decline that continues to this day The poverty resulting from the loss of thousands of jobs due to restructuring of industries from the 1960s to the 1980s meant that money was not available for property maintenance Houses were abandoned and thousands of structures were leveled during this time Much land sat vacant until the building and real estate boom of the 2000s Due to these factors , the total neighborhood population dropped from 124 , 937 in

specifically to an area of North Lawndale , and West Garfield Park , i e the area through which these streets pass between Pulaski Road and Cicero Avenue in which the names of many north south avenues begin with the letter K \( Keystone , Karlov , Kedvale , Keeler , Kenneth , Kilbourn , Kildare , Kolin , Kolmar , Komensky , Kostner , Kilpatrick , Kenton , Knox , and Keating \) The pattern is a historical relic of a 1913 street naming proposal , by which streets were to be systematically named according to their distance from the Illinois Indiana border K , the eleventh letter , was to be assigned to streets within the eleventh mile , counting west from the state line The eleventh mile is the easternmost area in which the plan was widely implemented , as many neighborhoods to the east
