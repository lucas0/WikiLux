Stoney Middleton is a village in the Derbyshire Dales district of Derbyshire , England It lies in the White Peak area of the Peak District southeast of Eyam and northwest of Calver , on the A623 road at the foot of the limestone valley of Middleton Dale History The village may have been a Roman settlement , perhaps based on lead mining , but there is currently no archaeological evidence to prove this A nineteenth century bath house over a hot spring is known locally as The Roman Baths but this was built in an unsuccessful attempt to establish a spa resort \( Following the clearance of undergrowth by the Stoney Middleton Youth Club in the early 1980s the building was consolidated and made secure by local craftsmen with the aid of a grant by the Peak Park Details of the Bath House \) It is speculated that a motte and bailey castle was built overlooking the village by the Normans during the pacification of the North in the late 11th and early 12th centuries However , again , there is no direct archaeological evidence for this and the rather small flattened top of the site known as Castle Hill , overlooking the Nook , may have been used for nothing more glamorous than dog fighting The origins of the name of the village go back to the Saxo Norman period when it was known as Middletone or MiddletuneDomesday Book A Complete Translation London Penguin , 2003 ISBN 0 14
