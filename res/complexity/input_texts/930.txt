accidents blocking the only roads into the \( fictional \) British village of Midwich , Winshire Attempting to approach the village , one ambulanceman becomes unconscious Suspecting gas poisoning , the army is notified They discover that a caged canary becomes unconscious upon entering the affected region , but regains consciousness when removed Further experiments reveal the region to be a hemisphere with a diameter of around the village Aerial photography shows an unidentifiable silvery object on the ground in the centre of the affected zone After one day the effect vanishes , along with the unidentified object , and the villagers wake with no apparent ill effects Some months later they realise that every woman of child bearing age is pregnant even those who are single or not otherwise in relationships with men with all indications that the pregnancies were caused by xenogenesis during the period of unconsciousness that has come to be referred to as the Dayout When the 31 boys and 30 girls are born they appear normal , except for their unusual , golden eyes , light blonde hair and pale , silvery skin These children have none of the genetic characteristics of their parents As they grow up , it becomes increasingly apparent that they are , at least in some respects , not human They possess telepathic abilities , and can control others' actions The Children \( they are referred to with a capital C \) have two distinct group minds one for the boys and another for the girls Their physical development is accelerated compared with that of humans upon reaching the age of nine , they appear to be sixteen year olds The Children protect themselves as much as possible using a form of mind control One young man who accidentally hits a Child in the hip while driving a car is made to drive into a wall and kill himself A bull that chased the Children is forced into a pond to drown The villagers form a mob and try to burn down the Midwich Grange where the Children are taught and live , but the Children make the villagers attack each other The Military Intelligence department learn that the same phenomenon has occurred in four other parts of the world , including an Inuit settlement in the Canadian Arctic , a small township in Australia 's Northern Territory , a Mongolian village and the town of Gizhinsk in eastern Russia , northeast of Okhotsk The Inuit killed the newborn Children , sensing they were not their own , and the Mongolians killed the Children and their mothers The Australian babies had all died within a few weeks , suggesting that something may have gone wrong with the xenogenesis process The Russian town was recently accidentally destroyed by the Soviet government , using an atomic cannon from a range of 50 60 miles The Children are aware of the threat against them , and use their power to prevent any aeroplanes from flying over the village During an interview with a Military Intelligence officer the Children explain that to solve the problem they must be destroyed They explain it is not possible to kill them unless the entire village is bombed , which results in civilian deaths The Children present an ultimatum They want to migrate to a secure location , where they can live unharmed They demand aeroplanes from the government An elderly , educated Midwich resident \( Gordon Zellaby \) realises the Children must be killed as soon as possible As he has only a few weeks left to live due to a heart condition , he feels an obligation to do something He has acted as a teacher and mentor of the Children and they regard him with as much affection as they can have for any human , permitting him to approach them more closely than they allow others to One evening , he in effect , abusing their trust hides a bomb in his projection equipment , while showing the Children a movie about the Greek islands Zellaby sets the timer on the bomb , killing himself and all of the Children Brood parasitism thumb Brood parasites such as cuckoos lay their eggs in other birds' nests for them to raise The cuckoo in the novel 's title alludes to a family of birds , of which nearly 60 species are brood parasites , laying their eggs in the nests of other birds Payne R B \( 1997 \) Family Cuculidae \( Cuckoos \) , pp 508 545 in del Hoyo J , Elliott A , Sargatal J \( eds \) \( 1997 \) Handbook of the Birds of the World

hatches earlier than the host 's , and the cuckoo chick grows faster in most cases the chick evicts the eggs or young of the host species , while encouraging the host to keep pace with its high growth

praised the novel as a most off trail and well written invasion yarn Thomas M Wagner of SFReviews net concluded in 2004 that the novel remains a cracking good read despite some obviously dated elements Damon Knight , however , wrote in 1967 that Wyndham 's novelistic treatment is deadly serious , and I'm sorry to say , deadly dull about page 90 the story begins to bog down under layers of polite restraint , sentimentality , lethargy and women 's magazine masochism , and it never lifts its head long again The writer Christina Hardyment , writing in The Times in 2008 , commented that the book packed even more of a punch in an age of genetic experimentation than it had done in the 1950s The dramatist Dan Rebellato , writing in The Guardian in 2010 , called Wyndham probably the most successful British science fiction author since H G Wells , and his books so familiar that people do not study them closely In Rebellato 's view , The Midwich Cuckoos was , on rereading , a searching novel of moral ambiguities where once I 'd seen only an inventive but simple SF thriller , a book that questioned the assumptions of its narrator character It dealt , he argued , with the struggle between men and women at least as much as between people and aliens , touching on rape , abortion , childbirth and motherhood , with a subtext a great deal more subtle than the narrator 's brusque story Rebellato observed , too , that Wyndham was writing in the 1950s under the Lord Chamberlain 's censorship for obscenity , so his use of misdirection , subtext , irony and ambiguity were necessary to allow publication of his discussion of sexuality Rebellato addresses , too , the New Wave science fiction writer Brian Aldiss 's criticism of Wyndham 's books as cosy catastrophes in his view , the stories may look like that , but they are surprisingly unheroic and often open ended , while underneath they are very uncosy , persistently unsettling , asking profound questions about the limits of Western culture The novelist Margaret Atwood , writing in Slate in 2015 , commented that in her opinion , The Midwich Cuckoos was his chef d'oeuvre , selling very well , cozy catastrophes or not , though she observed that one might as well call World War II of which Wyndham was a veteran a cozy war because not everyone died in it She noted , too , that just like the children in The Chrysalids , the cuckoo children use their special abilities to help each other and that Wyndham never made up his mind on the moral question of whether it would be a good thing to know exactly what other people were thinking Adaptations Books Wyndham began work on a sequel novel , Midwich Main , which he abandoned after only a few chapters Vivisection Schoolboy John Wyndham 's FirstPublication
