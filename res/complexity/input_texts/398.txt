thumb Therapeutic abortion is induced to avoid the risk of harm to the mother , or to avoid fetal in viability Therapeutic abortion is abortion induced following a diagnosis of medical necessity American Heritage Dictionary Such abortions are carried out in order to avoid the risk of substantial harm to the mother or in cases of fetal unviability In many countries therapeutic abortion is legal , including some where elective abortion is illegal Etymology Well according to Robert E Cooke , the word therapeutic means pertaining to treatment or healing Cooke , Robert E , et al The Terrible Choice The Abortion Dilemma New York Bantam Books inc , 1968 Print The word abortion in biology means the arrested development of an embryo or an organ at a more or less early stage Abortion Dictionary com Random House , Inc , 04 Mar 2010 Web 13 Dec 2010 http dictionary reference com browse abortion Description Many therapeutic abortions are performed today , with some degree of controversy regarding the quality of life , if the baby has a genetic condition which is thought likely to lead to a shorter life than that of a healthy child \( among such conditions would be severe cases of certain genetic conditions , conditions which entail the inability of certain vital organs such as the heart or liver to function without sustained support which are not amenable to surgical repair or transplantation , severe cases of profound mental impairment , the lack of portions of the brainstem or the higher brain , such as the cerebral hemispheres , or anencephaly , among others \) There is little evidence that a pregnancy with a disabled child is any more dangerous for the mother than that with a healthy child All pregnancies pose some risk to maternal health , but it is extremely rare that a problem with the baby 's health significantly increases the risk to the mother 's health In the vast majority of cases , pregnancies with babies with abnormalities progress without any extra risk to the mother Hence the controversy of using the term therapeutic abortion as a justification for aborting a baby with abnormalities Dangers in pregnancy to a mother 's health normally are the result of some underlying medical condition of the mother 's alone citation needed In developed countries in the West \( i e , most European countries and the United States , among others \) , the state of medical care for those pregnant women or those women who could become pregnant \( who can get access to affordable contemporary care and are given it in a timely manner \) is such the rare cases that would pose an indisputable threat to the mother 's life \( e g , most cases of ectopic pregnancy , uterine cancer , and certain other causes \) this can be diagnosed in a timely enough manner that a medical or surgical therapeutic abortion is performed before the situation becomes medically unstable That is decidedly not the case in remote areas of the Third World \( many areas of Asia and sub Saharan Africa \) with little access to advanced medical care , or in areas \( or social , relational , and familial situations \) where a woman 's right to emergency medical care is violated Many secular and religious ethical codes even those that consider other abortions to be extremely immoral will usually allow for an abortion , under the principle of double effect , where the medical crisis is the result of a natural biological phenomenon and is absolutely necessary to save the woman 's life disagreement persists , however , about what does or does not constitute an ethical justification for a non elective therapeutic abortion , particularly regarding genetic disorders or mental impairment Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine There are many situations in which therapeutic abortions are performed that do not involve a grave threat to the pregnant woman 's life , mobility , or physical health , and there are many cases where therapeutic abortions are performed in situations where the embryo or fetus is capable of surviving outside the mother 's body , with or without assistance or significant impairments In some developed societies , merely a pregnant woman 's stated desire to terminate her pregnancy is the only criterion necessary for an abortion to be deemed therapeutic , though this should not be confused with a therapeutic abortion performed because of a medical emergency Suzanne R Trupin , MD , Clinical Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology , University of Illinois College of Medicine Champaign CEO and Owner , Women 's Health Practice CEO and Owner , Hada Cosmetic Medicine and Midwest Surgical Center Historical background In many societies , a woman could only have as many children as she and her husband could provide for Since contraceptives first had their commercial boom in the 20th century , it was difficult for women to take preventative actions against getting pregnant In the present day , it is still difficult for many women to obtain proper contraceptives because of the economic situation of themselves or their country In cases where a woman is pregnant but could not provide for the child , it would often be considered necessary to abort the baby to save the other children from starvation For example , a study was done in Tuscany , Italy in 1427 that showed that the number of children per family had a direct correlation to the economic curve and survival conditions Paris , Ginette The Psychology of Abortion Trans Joanna Mott Putnam Spring Publications , inc , 1992 Print pp 11 Even in the 21st century there are still areas of the world that are in this situation The nomadic hunter gatherer people of the Kalahari Desert in Africa , called the Bushmen , can t have another child until their next oldest one is weaned from its mother s breast milk , which can be up to the age of 3 or 4 If a woman does get pregnant she must think of the child she has already and act quickly , before her love of her baby renders her incapable of killing it and forces her to wait and watch both of her children die Marshall , Elizabeth Thomas The Harmless People New York Vintage Books , 1989 Print pp 160 Paris said that the universal desire among women to control births expresses today , as it always has , the knowledge that survival depends on the ability to give each child what it needs for its full development , whether it be the survival of a mother , a family , or a community Paris , Ginette The Psychology of Abortion Trans Joanna Mott Putnam Spring Publications , inc , 1992 Print pp 17
