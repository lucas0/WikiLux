Before there were workhorse direct drive turntables in clubs , and belt drive turntables on audiophile racks , the standard mechanism for playing an Lp record was called the Idler drive , a system utilizing an intermediate wheel in a capstan arrangement , in closely coupled contact with the edge of the platter Unlike the beltdrive , which separates motor and platter via a compliant belt , and direct drive , which uses a low speed direct current motor , Idler drive most often used a high speed circa 1600 rpm alternating current motor engaged to an intermediate , or Idler wheel , to rotate the platter Transcription turntables must have speed accuracy and wow and flutter specifications that met professional broadcasting standards Starting production in 1953 , the first Garrard transcription turntable that supported all extant commercial playback formats , 33 , 45 , 78 rpm records , was called the Garrard 301 The later 401 was nearly identical mechanically , but with an exterior redesigned for the swinging sixties Both models were utilized by the BBC and in commercial radio stations , mostly in Europe the 301and to a lesser extent the 401 were also exported around the world The 401 was produced until 1976 In an unlikely exchange of technologies , by the early eighties notions of 'modern' and 'antiquated' were both being revisited as the Compact Disc was being introduced in the West by the consortium of Sony and Philips , small groups of audio enthusiasts in Japan and also in France were narrowing their sights to investigate what might be called the overlooked technologies of the fifties , notably vacuum tube amplification and Idler drive Lp playback amongst others Content to forego Cd marketing 's perfect sound forever scheme , these groups were by any measure a contrarian micro movement , even in audiophile circles , but they kept acquiring new members They would maintain they were after a more purist sound , untouched by what they saw the as the market s misleading over reliance on impressive but ever more unrealistic specifications , and needless , flashy features Analog sound , unaltered by digital sampling reconstruction on the source side , and without the shifted harmonics inherent in much transistor amplification of the time , would be their goal As reliable , well built idler machines , the Garrard 301 401 models became the source component of choice for what was loosely labelled the Ultra Fi resurgence , guided by French audio critic Jean Hiraga and others , in Europe and Japan Long out of production , Garrard 301 and 401 models today are sold on the used market for as much as ten to twenty times their original cost Even though Lp Records themselves are several bygone formats older by now , they are still produced in late 2007 and they continue to intrigue new generations with their warm and coherent sound quality References External links E W Mortimer , Transcription Turntable Design article Haden Boardman , Sound Practices article Lynn Olson , Tiny History Of High Fidelity article , part one Lynn Olson , Tiny History Of High Fidelity article , part two Ken Kessler , Hifi News Record Review article Roy Poulton , Hi Fi World article Garrard History article , Swindon Web Category DJing Category Turntables
