The Czech Republic 's reaction to the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence follows Kosovo 's declaration of independence from Serbia , enacted on 17 February 2008 by the Kosovan Parliament The act proclaimed the Republic of Kosovo On 21 May 2008 , the Czech Republic became the 41st state to formally recognize Kosovo When Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008 , the Czech government initially declared that they would not immediately recognize Kosovo as an independent state , instead the Czech Republic would wait for the European Union to come up with a common stance towards the declaration It became clear shortly afterwards that the EU would have no common stand on recognition of Kosovo due to objections from members such as Spain , Romania , Greece , and Slovakia Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg then announced that the Czech Republic would take a wait and see approach they would observe how many nations recognize Kosovo , and the way in which the Kosovo government behaves Prior to the 17 February declaration , the Czech Social Democratic Party and Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia signaled their opposition to recognizing any unilateral declaration by Kosovo Shortly after the declaration they stayed true to their pre declaration words , with the two parties proclaiming a similarity between Kosovo 's declaration and the 1938 Munich Agreement President V clav Klaus also sympathized with the Serbian side , saying that the Czech Republic must take into account the traditional friendly relations between the Czech and Serbian nations and that the Serbian nation has always sided with us in time of difficult historic trials Meanwhile , early supporters of recognizing Kosovo as an independent state included Alexandr Vondra , the Minister of European Affairs Vondra predicted that the Czech government would eventually recognize Kosovo , saying It is sort of like dancing on eggshells , it is like handling a powder keg In situations like this , I think it is better to be really careful We will wait , we will evaluate the situation there is no hurry It will certainly not happen this week but let 's be realists we certainly wo n't wait for six months Both Prime Minister Mirek Topol nek and Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg eventually declared their support for recognizing Kosovo Topol nek tried to get recognition through the cabinet of the Czech government just prior to the NATO summit in Bucharest However , his attempt was unsuccessful because a significant part of the governing Civic Democratic Party opposed recognition According to an opinion poll published in early April 2008 , 53 of a polled population believed that the independence declaration against Serbia 's wishes would have negative consequences for stability in the Balkans , while 67 of them did not think that independence would help normalize relations between Serbs and Albanians in the slightest bit , but will rather exacerbate them further Finally , 36 opposed Kosovo 's unilateral independence declaration , 34 supported it , while the remaining 30 were undecided Encouraged by the results of the May 2008 parliamentary elections in Serbia in which the For a European Serbia coalition did much better than expected , previously skeptical ministers of the Czech government reconsidered their positions and began to support recognition of Kosovo It is important to note that the For a European Serbia coalition is opposed to the unilateral declaration by the Kosovo government , however it also wants Serbia to join the EU After three months of debate , on 21 May the Czech Republic recognized Kosovo as an independent nation because recognition will strengthen the overall stability in the region the government said After the recognition was announced by the Czech government , Serbia responded by recalling its ambassador from Prague This was not an unusual move as , in an act of protest , Serbia had pulled all of their ambassadors from nations which recognized Kosovo Before the Serbian ambassador left Prague , he met with President V clav Klaus After the meeting Klaus said that he was especially alarmed by the words of Serbian Ambassador Vladimir Vere that Serbs had not taken it personally when Kosovo was recognized by countries such as Finland and the Netherlands , but that they were hurt by the action of the Czech government Klaus also said that he felt ashamed because of the Czech government 's decision As regards the opposition , their members still insisted that the recognition is a shame and a violation of international law Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg , while admitting the decision is unpopular in some quarters , defended the government 's decision by saying that independent Kosovo was a reality and Czech diplomacy would now be able to pursue active policies not only toward Kosovo , but also toward Serbia A month after recognizing Kosovo as an independent state , this was still a hot political issue and the government was still advocating their decision from the opposers' critique On 16 July 2008 the Czech government upgraded their liaison office in Pristina to an embassy led by a charg d'affaires Belgrade also announced that its ambassadors will return to the EU countries that recognised Kosovo The ambassador to the Czech Republic returned on 3 August 2008 According to a poll published in July 2008 , 30 of the polled population agreed with the government 's decision to recognize independent Kosovo , 31 opposed it , and 39 were undecided See also International reaction to the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence References Category Foreign relations of the Czech Republic
