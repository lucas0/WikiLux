The Japanese Sea Lion \( Zalophus japonicus or Zalophus californianus japonicus \) is thought to have become extinct in the 1950s There have been no documented reports of Z japonicus since the late 1950s The last credible report was 50 to 60 individuals on Takeshima in 1951 \( Rice 1998 \) Individual sightings reported as recently as 1974 and 1975 , cannot be confirmed as confusion with escaped Z californianus cannot be ruled out Zalophus californianus japonicus \( CR \) , Red Data Book , Japan Integrated Biodiversity Information System , Ministry of the Environment \( Japan \) The Japanese sea lion \( Zalophus californianus japonicus \) was common in the past around the coast of the Japanese Archipelago , but declined rapidly after 1930 's from overhunting and increased competition with commercial fisheries The last record in Japan was a juvenile , captured in 1974 at off the coast of Rebun Island , northern Hokkaido Prior to 2003 it was considered to be a subspieces of California Sea Lion \( Zalophus californianus japonicus \) however , it was subsequently reclassified as a separate species But many taxonomists still consider it as a subspecies of the California Sea Lion Some have argued that japonicus , californianus , and wollenbaeki \( Gal pagos Sea Lion \) are distinct species because of their distant habitation areas and behavioral differences They inhabited the Sea

reaching lengths of 2 3 to 2 5 meters these were larger than male California Sea Lions Females were significantly smaller at 1 64 meters long with a lighter color than the males Range and habitat Japanese Sea Lions were primarily found in the Sea of Japan along the coastal areas of the Korean Peninsula , the mainlands of the Japanese Archipelago \( the both sides on the Pacific Ocean and Sea

Japanese businessman , built a fishery house on the uninhabited Liancourt Rocks to aid in harvesting them and subsequently , until the outbreak of World War II in 1941 , the hunting of sea lions in this location was subject to government approval Incorporation of Takeshima into Shimane Prefecture , Ministry of Foreign Affairs \( Japan \) A former fisherman of the Oki Islands stated that they

early 1900s show that as many as 3 , 200 sea lions were harvested at the turn of the century and overfishing caused harvest numbers to fall drastically to 300 sea lions by 1915 and to few dozen sea lions by the 1930s Commercial harvest of Japanese sea lions ended in the 1940s when the species became virtually extinct In total , Japanese trawlers harvested as many as 16 , 500 sea lions , enough

californianus seals Population Revival Efforts The South Korean Ministry of Environment initiated an effort to search for and reintroduce sea lions to their native habitat The National Institute of Environmental Research of Korea was commissioned to conduct feasibility research for this project \( \) \( Request for Research on Feasibility of Reintroducing Dokdo Sea Lions \) , South Korean Ministry of Environment , 2006 01 09 In 2007 a joint research venture between North Korea , South Korea , Russia , and China was announced Surviving California sea lion populations will be searched in Chinese and Russian waters with hopes reintroducing the stock to not only the Liancourt Rocks , but all over the coast of Sea of Japan If they can not find them , the South Korean government plans to bring some from the United States The South Korean Ministry of Environment said that it is meaningful in the senses of the territorial symbolism , the national concern , the restoration of ecologic systems , and possible eco tourisms , to restore the sea lions on the Liancourt Rocks that became extinct by Japanese overhunting References Category Fur seals and sea lions Category Extinct
