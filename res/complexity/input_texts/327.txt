base Pollack \( 2002 \) , p 125 Prelude In the summer of 1973 , Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114 accidentally flew over Sinai It was ordered by the IAF to land but refused and was subsequently shot down The IAF high command feared this might lead to a reprisal against El Al planes en route to South Africa and back , and deployed two Phantoms at Ofira Another reason for deploying the phantoms was to watch out for MiGs from Hurghada that periodically threatened the small Israeli navy Red Sea flotilla , and the Hawk missile batteries guarding the Red Sea straits Yonay \( 1993 \) , pp 318 319 The base commander was Yak Nevo On Yom Kippur , 6 October , 1973 , there were two pilots in the base , codenamed Hemi and Shuki , and two copilots , Bino and Mor All were relatively inexperienced At 9 00 AM they were given a red alert by the controller At 1 50 PM the sirens were sounded The controller ordered them to stay alert but after a few seconds told them he saw several low flying formations on advancing toward them on the radar Hemi decided to ignore the orders , told the mechanics to start the planes and took off Shuki joined him Cohen \( 1990 \) , pp 453 454 Battle Soon after take off , the MiGs began bombing the runways Hemi took charge and told Shuki to dump the detachable fuel tanks and to take the west end of the base while he would take the east one Hemi shot down one MiG with a Sidewinder missile He turned back toward the base and crossed two MiGs bombing it They rose and flew away The base 's MIM 23 Hawk battery held fire to avoid hitting the Israeli planes , and two MiGs dived down to destroy it Hemi started to chase the leading MiG flying as low as possible and fired his Gatling gun but missed The MiG aborted its bombing mission Hemi tried to chase it , but found out his right engine was turned off , presumably because the engine 's flame died down while he was firing He tried to start the engine in mid air He broke away from the MiG to attack its partner 's tail The MiG turned sharply toward him Hemi pulled up until he was facing the MiG and passed it by and shot it down The second MiG fled Cohen \( 1990 \) , pp 454 457 Hemi saw another pair of MiG 17s attacking a nearby communications unit near the bay They were startled and one of them fired its air to surface missiles at Hemi , who shot it down with guided missile at a distance of 600 meters Meanwhile , Shuki shot down three planes and was looking for the fourth Two MiG 21s attacked One of them found itself in an inferior position and descended at a speed of 500 knots to sea level , hit water , bounced back up and bounced up again Then it pulled up and flew away Shuki was running out of fuel and intended to land on the damaged runway Hemi was blinded by a by a flash of light reflected by another pair of MiGs trying to escape Hemi shot it down and its partner fled to the mountains Hemi had almost run out of fuel and decided not to chase it Cohen \( 1990 \) , pp 457 458
