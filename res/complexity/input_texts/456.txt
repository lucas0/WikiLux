and gave the film 3 stars \( out of 4 \) and said The movie reminded me a little of National Lampoon 's Animal House , except that it 's more mature , as all movies are Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times said Physically , Hill and Cera recall the classic comic duos Laurel and Hardy , Abbott and Costello , Aykroyd and Belushi But they are contemporary kids , sophisticated and sensitive to nuance she added , I hope it 's not damning the movie with the wrong kind of praise to say that for a film so deliriously smutty , Superbad is supercute Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly said 2007 the year Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen saved movie comedy , a reference to Knocked Up which was released in June Devin Gordon of Newsweek said As a Revenge of the Nerds redux , Superbad is n't perfect But it 's super close In a more critical vein , Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter , compared the film to other films with a single day structure , such as American Graffiti and Dazed and Confused , but said that Superbad does n't have the smarts or the depths of those ensemble comedies The Hollywood Reporter review was referenced in the film 's DVD audio commentary , particularly the review 's suggestion that the two main characters have a homoerotic experience similar to the film Y Tu Mam Tambi n The DVD audio commentary on the Superbad Unrated Extended Edition DVD Adam Graham of The Detroit News said , the cops belong in a bad Police Academy sequel , not this movie , and also that the film falls short of teen classic status Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel called the film super derivative , super raunchy , and Freaks and Geeks Uncensored Moore went on to say the film shamelessly plagiarizes from films such as Ca n't Hardly Wait and American Graffiti He also said , Like Knocked Up , this is a comedy they do n't know how to end The energy flags as it overstays its welcome Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe said the film has a degree more sophistication than Revenge of the Nerds and American Pie , and less than the underrated House Party Morris also said , the few smart observations could have come from an episode of one of Apatow 's TV shows and I wanted to find this as funny as audiences did The film was listed as on Empires 500 Greatest films of all time Awards Won Canadian Comedy Awards 2008 Seth Rogen Best Writing Rogen could not attend the awards
