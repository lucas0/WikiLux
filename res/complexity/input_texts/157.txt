thumb right Felix Hoffmann Felix Hoffmann \( January 21 , 1868 February 8 , 1946 \) was a German chemist , credited for the first synthesized medically useful forms of heroin and aspirin , though some sources maintain that Arthur Eichengr n was the real creator of the latter Hoffmann was born in Ludwigsburg and studied Chemistry in Munich In 1894 , he joined the Bayer pharmaceutical research facility in Elberfeld He is best known for having synthesized acetylsalicylic acid \( ASA \) on August 10 , 1897 , for the first time in a stable form usable for medical applications Bayer marketed this substance as Aspirin However , this has been disputed In 1949 , Arthur Eichengr n published a paper in which he claimed to have planned and directed the synthesis of Aspirin along with the synthesis of several related compounds He also claimed to be responsible for Aspirin 's initial surreptitious clinical testing Finally , he claimed that Hoffmann 's role was restricted to the initial lab synthesis using his \( Eichengr n 's \) process and nothing more Eichengr n A 50 Jahre Aspirin Pharmazie 1949 4 582 4 \( in German \) The Eichengr n version was ignored by historians and chemists until 1999 , when Walter Sneader of the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow re examined the matter and concluded that Eichengr n 's account is convincing and correct and that Eichengr n deserves credit for the invention of Aspirin Sneader W The discovery of aspirin a reappraisal BMJ 2000 321 1591 4 PMID 11124191 Bayer promptly denied this theory in a press release , claiming that the invention of Aspirin was due to Hoffmann , the controversy is still open while Sneader 's version has been widely reported , there are no independent second sources supporting either version Both substances had been synthesized earlier , but not in forms that could be used for medication ASA had first been synthesized by Frenchman Charles Fr d ric Gerhardt in 1853 , and diacetylmorphine \( that is , heroin \) by C R Alder Wright , a British chemist in 1873 Following the synthesis of aspirin , Hoffmann changed to the pharmaceutical marketing department , where he stayed until his retirement in 1928 In 2002 , he was inducted into the US National Inventors Hall of Fame Notes See also Arthur Eichengr n German inventors and discoverers Category 1868 births Category 1949 deaths Category German chemists Category German inventors Category Heroin Category National Inventors Hall of Fame inductees ca Felix Hoffmann de Felix Hoffmann es Felix Hoffmann fr Felix Hoffmann ko id Felix Hoffmann it Felix Hoffmann he nl Felix Hoffmann \( chemicus \) pl Felix Hoffmann pt Felix Hoffmann ru , fi Felix Hoffmann vi Felix Hoffmann
