Newspeak is a fictional language in George Orwell 's novel Nineteen Eighty Four In the novel , it is described as being the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year Orwell included an essay about it in the form of an appendixOrwell , George \( 1949 \) Nineteen Eighty Four , Appendix The Principles of Newspeak , pp 309 323 New York Plume , 2003 Pynchon , Thomas \( 2003 \) Foreword to the Centennial Edition to Nineteen Eighty Four , pp vii xxvi New York Plume , 2003 Fromm , Erich \( 1961 \) Afterword to Nineteen Eighty Four , pp 324 337 New York Plume , 2003 Orwell 's text has a Selected Bibliography , pp 338 9 the foreword and the afterword each contain further references Copyright is explicitly extended to digital and any other means Plume edition is a reprint of a hardcover by Harcourt Plume edition is also in a Signet edition in which the basic principles of the language are explained Newspeak is closely based on English but has a greatly reduced and simplified vocabulary and grammar This suits the totalitarian regime of the Party , whose aim is to make any alternative thinking \( thoughtcrime \) or speech impossible by removing any words or possible constructs which describe the ideas of freedom , rebellion and so on One character says admiringly of the shrinking volume of the new dictionary It 's a beautiful thing , the destruction of words The Newspeak term for the English language is Oldspeak Oldspeak was intended to have been completely eclipsed by Newspeak before 2050 The genesis of Newspeak can be found in the constructed language Basic English , which Orwell promoted from 1942 to 1944 before emphatically rejecting it in his essay Politics and the English Language In this paper he laments the quality of the English of his day , citing examples of dying metaphors , pretentious diction or rhetoric , and meaningless words all of which contribute to fuzzy ideas and a lack of logical thinking Towards the end of this essay , having argued his case , Orwell muses Thus forcing the use of Newspeak , according to Orwell , describes a deliberate intent to exploit this degeneration with the aim of oppressing its speakers Basic principles of Newspeak To remove synonyms antonyms The basic idea behind Newspeak is to remove all shades of meaning from language , leaving simple dichotomies \( pleasure and pain , happiness and sadness , good thoughts and thoughtcrimes \) which reinforce the total dominance of the State Similarly , Newspeak root words served as both nouns and verbs , which allowed further reduction in the total number of words for example , think served as both noun and verb , so the word thought was not required and could be abolished A staccato rhythm of short syllables was also a goal , further reducing the need for deep thinking about language \( See duckspeak \) Successful Newspeak meant that there would be fewer and fewer words dictionaries would get thinner and thinner In addition , words with opposite meanings were removed as redundant , so bad became ungood Words with comparative and superlative meanings were also simplified , so better became gooder , and best likewise became goodest Intensifiers could be added , so great became plusgood , and excellent or splendid likewise became doubleplusgood Adjectives were formed by adding the suffix ful to a root word \( e g , goodthinkful , orthodox in thought \) , and adverbs by adding wise \( goodthinkwise , in an orthodox manner \) In this manner , as many words as possible were removed from the language The ultimate aim of Newspeak was to reduce even the dichotomies to a single word that was a yes of some sort an obedient word with which everyone answered affirmatively to what was asked of them Some of the constructions in Newspeak which Orwell derides , such as replacing bad with ungood , are in fact characteristic of agglutinative languages , although foreign to English It is also possible that Orwell modeled aspects of Newspeak on Esperanto for example ungood is constructed similarly to the Esperanto word malbona Orwell had been exposed to Esperanto in 1927 when living in Paris with his aunt Kate Limouzin and her husband Eug ne Lanti , a prominent Esperantist Esperanto was the language of the house , and Orwell was disadvantaged by not speaking it , which may account for some antipathy towards the language To control thought The underlying theory of Newspeak is that if something ca n't be said , then it ca n't be thought One question raised in response to this is whether we are defined by our language , or whether we actively define it For instance , how can we communicate the need for freedom , or organize an uprising , if we do not have the words for either \? This is related to the Sapir Whorf hypothesis , and Ludwig Wittgenstein 's proposition , The limits of my language mean the limits to my world However , this view is disputed by authors like Gene Wolfe \( see the article on his Ascian language \) Examples of Newspeak , from the novel , include crimethink doubleplusungood and Ingsoc They mean , respectively thought crime extremely bad and English Socialism , the official political philosophy of the Party The word Newspeak itself also comes from the language Note that all of these words would be obsolete and should be removed in the final version of Newspeak , except for doubleplusungood in certain contexts Generically , Newspeak has come to mean any attempt to restrict disapproved language by a government or other powerful entity Real life examples of Newspeak A comparison to Newspeak may arguably be seen in polarised and simplified political and journalistic rhetoric , where the arguments of either side ultimately reduce to four legs good , two legs bad , in Orwellian terminology \( see Animal Farm \) A correlated phenomenon is the dumbing down of political discourse , seen in the employment of soundbites for the benefit of , or by , the media Historical and pre Historical change of the meaning of words Friedrich Nietzsche , speaking about the morality of winner in his work Genealogy of Morals , cites some examples of words in some languages which have probably undergone a change in their meaning following a victory of a people over another For instance , the Latin word malus which means both bad and dark haired may take its origin to a previous Celtic invasion of Italy , by which the victorious Celts who had fairer hair than Italic population used to associate the losers with the idea of badness In German Nietzsche observes that schlicht \( simple \) is very close to schlecht \( bad \) That is , some words were coined by the victorious populations to add connotations to other words or concepts Politically correct euphemisms Charges of Newspeak are sometimes advanced when a group tries to replace a word phrase that is politically unsuitable \( e g , civilian casualties \) or offensive \( e g , murder \) with an alternative , inoffensive euphemism \( e g , collateral damage which has also been substituted by another euphemism collateral effect \) , or falsely innocuous \( as in liquidate the kulaks or resettle the Jews , as used by the Soviets or the Nazis , respectively , to conceal their democides \) Some people maintain that to make certain words or phrases unspeakable \( thoughtcrime \) through the attempt to make language politically correct restricts what ideas may be held \( Newspeak \) and is therefore tantamount to censorship Others believe that expunging terms that have fallen out of favor or become insulting will make people less likely to hold outdated or offensive views Either way , there is a resemblance between censorship due to moral dogmatisms and Newspeak , although some may feel that they differ in their intentions in Nineteen Eighty Four , Newspeak is instituted to enhance the power of the state over the individual politically correct language , on the other hand , is said by supporters to free individuals from stereotypical preconceptions caused by the use of prejudicial terminology It is this attempt to change thought through changing \( or eliminating \) words that earns political correctness the connection to Newspeak In the Spanish Civil War , both parties called each other by dysphemistical names Perhaps the best description is it began as a conflict of Republicans and Nationalists , and ended up as a war of Communists and Fascists Political groups often use neologisms to frame their views positively and to discredit their opponents' views One of the most prominent and heated examples is the U S abortion debates Those advocating restrictions on abortion label themselves pro life , seeing the term abortion or the idea of aborting a pregnancy as euphemistic for murder of an unborn child and leaving their opponents , who do not view the human organism as being its own person in pre natal stages of development , and who see the issue as being not about life or death but primarily about women 's rights , presumably anti life or pro death Using a similar tactic , those advocating abortions emphasize that women 's bodies should not become property of the State upon conception , emphasizing their own concerns by labeling themselves pro choice thus labeling their opponents anti women and anti choice Members of either side are commonly heard expressing views that the other camp 's self label is a dishonest , or at the very least overly simplistic In modern business , it is often frowned upon to use words with a negative connotation , such as problem and instead problems are referred to as challenges , obstacles , or even opportunities Three examples unrelated to political correctness are Basic English , a language which takes pride in reducing the number of English words , World English and E Prime , another simplified version of English Abbreviations and Acronyms Another common use of Newspeak today is the overuse of abbreviations To quote from the 1984 appendix , It was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning , by cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it Attention is also drawn to the use of such abbreviations by totalitarian regimes prior to World War II \( see Gestapo , Comintern , Agitprop , Minculpop \) Even more powerful are acronyms like USA PATRIOT Act , Ofcom , OPEC , NAMbLA , PETA , NAFTA , NICE , and the PROTECT Act which can be pronounced as if they were proper words This is most vividly seen in acronyms like laser , scuba , and radar , which are in widespread use today and are nearly always written in lowercase in fact , large portions of the population may be entirely unaware that such words originated as acronyms On July 5 1959 President Sukarno of Indonesia abolished parliamentary democracy and established a system of government by decree called Manifesto Politik or in short Manipol an abbreviation greatly reminiscent of those in Orwell 's book , though there is no evidence that Sukarno read the book or was directly influenced by it In a similar way , the Indonesian term Tapol \( political prisoner \) first used as a derogatory word by the authorities , later adopted as a term of pride by the tapols themselves was created from the first syllables of prisoner and political See also List of Newspeak words Buzzword Code word \( figure of speech \) Framing \( social sciences \) Language and thought Neologism Nineteen
