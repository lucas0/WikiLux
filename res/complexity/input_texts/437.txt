DISH Network is a direct broadcast satellite \( DBS \) service that provides satellite television and audio programming to households and businesses in the United States , owned by parent company EchoStar Communications Corporation DISH Network was launched in March 1996 , and , along with DirecTV , primarily competes with cable television providers throughout the United States It is based at Meridian , Colorado , though the postal designation of nearby Englewood is commonly listed as the company 's location in corporate filings and news accounts History EchoStar was formed in 1980 by its Chairman and CEO Charles W Ergen as a distributor of C band TV systems On December 28 , 1995 EchoStar successfully launched its first satellite , EchoStar I The launch of Echostar I was a gamble in that it was one of the first successful commercial launches from China after a series of spectacular failures That same year , EchoStar established the DISH Network brand name to market its home satellite TV system The company used DISH as an acronym for Digital Sky Highway http www dishnetwork com content aboutus satellites echo1 index shtml In 2003 , DISH Network began providing in flight satellite TV service to the U S airline Song In 2004 , selected music channels from Sirius Satellite Radio were added to DISH Network 's lineup of audio only channels that already include Muzak audio services for both households and businesses DISH Network was also partnered with Starband to deliver broadband satellite Internet service along with its television service The partnership ended in 2003 Currently , DISH Network has partnership agreements with a number of local telephone providers to cross market DSL and DISH Network services In June 2006 , Dish Network signed an agreement to partner with WildBlue to deliver broadband via satellite On January 4 , 2006 EchoStar announced that DISH Network surpassed 12 million paid subscribers In the last five years , DISH Network added more than 6 74 million net new customers , more than all other satellite TV and cable companies during the same period As of Februrary 2007 , DISH Network reported reaching the 13 million customer mark Each month , DISH Network broadcasts a show titled Charlie Chat , which features news about upcoming hardware , programming events , and new channels Company CEO Charlie Ergen and Jim De Franco host the show and take questions from e mail and live callers On March 13 , 2006 a special 90 minute edition of Charlie Chats aired at 9 p m \( Eastern time \) to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the launch of the DISH Network to its customers Recently , Dish Network has started to provide Internet access to compete with cable companies Since its launch in 1996 , 30 million viewers in 12 million households have subscribed at some point in time to DISH Network programming http www 2020sat com dish network articles Removal of channels In March 2004 , Dish Network dropped all Viacom channels when Dish and Viacom waged a public war over a disputed contract By the end of the week , they settled their dispute and Viacom 's channels were returned In October 2005 , DISH Network dropped OLN \( now known as Versus \) Comcast , the Philadelphia , Pennsylvania based cable provider that owned OLN , refused to provide its National Hockey League coverage to DISH Network , because it was not available on a sufficiently high penetration tier DISH Network then removed OLN from its lineup indefinitely , claiming that customers would eventually have to pay more for a service that few of its 12 million customers actually watched On April 24 , 2006 , DISH Network and OLN reached a long term agreement to carry the channel once more On January 1 , 2006 , DISH Network cut service of two additional channels to its subscribers Lifetime Television , and its sister network Lifetime Movie Network According to DISH Network , Lifetime demanded a 70 price increase for its programming , whereas Lifetime claimed the increase was only pennies The companies came to an agreement and restored the channels on 1 February 2006 As of December 1 , 2006 , Dish Network lost a court case and cut distant local channels \( ABC , NBC , CBS , and FOX from NYC or LA \) This has no impact on the vast majority of Dish Network subscribers However , distant local subscribers that were impacted have been provided a simple work around to correct this issue Those affected may still receive distant local channels by using a 3rd party provider and their same Dish Network equipment by contacting All American Direct \( http www mydistantnetworks com \) Customers choosing this option would continue to get both Dish Network channels and All American Direct Channels through the same receiver and these channels would be seamlessly integrated into the channel list On January 1 , 2007 , Turner Broadcasting System ceased delivery of Court TV to Dish Network customers , after EchoStar and Turner Broadcasting System were unable to agree on terms for a new carriage agreement Echostar has insisted that Turner was demanding a more than 70 rate increase We are working hard to negotiate a fair contract with Turner Networks and CourtTV , said Eric Sahl , senior vice president of Programming for EchoStar s DISH Network But we must also protect our customers from unreasonable demands It is not fair to ask our customers to pay a DBS premium for a channel owned by the second largest cable operator , Time Warner We take pride in offering consumers the best value for pay TV service in the industry , and we remain committed to keeping our cost structure low to the benefit of our customers http www dishnetwork com content programming missingchannels courttv index shtml Court TV was put back on Dish Network 200 package February 9 , 2007 http www dishnetwork com content whats on dish courtTV index shtml Specific terms of the deal were not disclosed , however , both parties were pleased with the financial terms of the agreement In April 2007 , DISH Network announced that they will not be carrying the MLB Extra Innings package for the 2007 season You can read the full announcement via DISHNetwork com Technical information Satellites locations In 1987 , EchoStar applied for a DBS license with the Federal Communications Commission and was granted access to geostationary orbital slot 119 West longitude in 1992 http www satsig net sslist htm In 1996 , EchoStar and Dominion Video Satellite , Inc , proprietor of the Sky Angel DBS service , formed a technical agreement where Dominion has co located its FCC licensed DBS frequencies and channels on the same DBS satellite , EchoStar III \( 61 5 West longitude \) , carrying DBS frequencies and channels licensed by the FCC to EchoStar The two DBS companies operate independently of one another , and subscribers to each service are not required to subscribe to both services , however , this technical agreement enables individuals , at their option , to subscribe to both services using the same satellite receiving system In 1999 , EchoStar obtained the broadcasting assets of a failed joint venture between ASkyB and MCI WorldCom , including 28 transponders at the 110 W orbital location On May 1 , 2005 , EchoStar added the first ten of the 21 original Voom channels These channels were made available at a 61 5 W orbital slot position \( The Voom channels are now available from either 61 5 W or 129 W locations \) EchoStar planned to carry all 21 original Voom channels by 2006 http www corporate ir net ireye ir site zhtml \? ticker dish script 410 layout 6 item id 703340 \( more information here \) Currently 15 Voom channels are carried exclusively on Dish Network On February 15 , 2006 , Echostar X , the tenth satellite in Echostar 's fleet , was successfully launched By mid May it successfully began broadcasting from the 110 W orbital location to satisfy a legal mandate \( passed by Congress in December 2004 \) for single dish local into local service Dish Network Satellite Locations List Please refer to the article EchoStar for detailed satellite location

channels varies Satellite dishes DISH Network offers different types of satellite receiving equipment for obtaining signals from its diverse satellite fleet Most of their consumer boxes are manufactured by Sanmina SCI Corporation to Echostar specifications There remain communities in the U S where cable companies collude with condominium associations and landlords to keep DirecTV and DISH Network out by preventing potential customers from choosing any television services other than the ones provided by the local cable company Often , this is accomplished through unlawful lease provisions and unlawful restrictive covenants against the appropriate placement of the required parabolic antennae This has been so great a problem for DBS companies and for the United States that federal law now provides , in 47 CFR 1 4000 , against this blatant and unlawful restraint on trade DISH 300 right thumb DISH Network 's DISH 300 in its original box DISH Network 's first satellite antenna was simply called the DISH Network dish It was retroactively named the DISH 300 when legal and satellite problems forced delays of the forthcoming DISH 500 systems It uses one LNB to obtain signals from the 119 W orbital location , and is commonly used as a second dish to receive additional high definition or ethnic programming from either the 148 W or 61 5 W orbital locations The 119 W slot is one of two primary orbital locations that provide core services DISH 500 left thumb Two DISH Network 500 dishes mounted on a rooftop After EchoStar obtained the broadcasting assets of a failed joint venture between ASkyB and MCI Worldcom , it had more than doubled its capacity by adding 28 transponders at the 110 W orbital location Since EchoStar also owned the adjacent 119 W orbital location it developed the DISH 500 to receive the signals of both orbital locations using one dish and an innovative dual LNB assembly Although the new 20 inch DISH 500 was slightly larger than the then current 18 inch DISH 300 and DirecTV dishes it had the distinct advantage of obtaining signals from EchoStar 's two adjacent satellite locations for a theoretical 500 channel capacity The DISH 500 , as a result , provided very large capacity for local into local service , nationwide programming , and business services In order to migrate existing customers to DISH 500 , DISH Network provides value added channels in addition to local channels that can only be received with the DISH 500 and newer systems Some of these channels exclusive to these newer systems are History Channel International , Boomerang , The Science Channel , and Discovery Home With the launch of EchoStar X in 2006 at 110 W thousands of local channels will only be available with a DISH 500 system DISH 1000 right thumb DISH Network 's DISH 1000 In spite of all this capacity EchoStar still needed to fulfill the dream of nationwide high definition television and conceived the DISH 1000 system to receive signals from 110 W , 119 W and 129 W orbital locations Originally , DISH Network high definition subscribers required two separate satellite dishes Today , approximately 70 of DISH Network subscribers can receive nationwide HDTV channels using the 129 W orbital location , but since the 129 W does not effectively cover the entire United States this solution is not available for large populations of customers in the Northeastern , mid Atlantic , and deep Southern regions of the United States Unfortunately , some DISH 1000 subscribers still need a second satellite dish to receive high definition local channels Furthermore , technical problems with the partially failed satellites used at 129 W have left the reception of high definition content with the DISH 1000 an unfulfilled promise for many DISH Network customers SuperDISH , DISH 500 , and DISH 1000 left thumb DISH Network 's SuperDISH 121 mounted on a roof During DISH Network 's quest for capacity , they had accumulated a dizzying array of satellite broadcasting technologies , orbital locations , and surplus capacity using non mainstream technologies requiring larger dish sizes To capitalize on these broadcasting assets DISH Network started providing extensive ethnic programming that receive programming from lower powered satellites broadcasting in the non DBS portion of the FSS band DISH Network offers specialized equipment for these customers including larger dish antennas The SuperDISH , DISH 500 , and DISH 1000 systems receive DBS signals from both of the primary 110 W and 119 W locations \( 129 W for DISH 1000 \) as well as lower powered FSS signals from either 121 W \( Required for KBS World \) , 105 W , or 118 75 W To underscore how exotic these systems can be the DISH 500 and 1000 systems receive circularly polarized signals in the non DBS portion of the FSS band the only American satellite television service to do so right thumb DISH Network 's DISH 1000 Broadcast technology While for years DISH Network has used standard MPEG 2 for broadcasting , the addition of bandwidth intensive HDTV in a limited bandwidth world has called for a change to an MPEG 4 system DISH Network announced as of 1 February 2006 , that all new HDTV channels would be available in MPEG 4 format only , while maintaining the current lineup as MPEG 2 Both a standard receiver and a DVR \( Digital Video Recorder \) are available to subscribers for an upgrade fee DISH Network intends to eventually convert the entire platform to MPEG 4 in order to provide more channels to subscribers Number of subscribers by year Year
