social impact of the industry and its organisation of global and regional summits focused on issues and developments relevant to the industry History The World Travel and Tourism Council began in the 1980s with a group of business executives led by former American Express CEO James D Robinson III The group was formed to discuss the travel and tourism industry and the need for more data relating to the importance of what some believed was a non essential industry Discussions led to the first meeting of the WTTC in Paris , France in 1989 The first meeting included a speech by former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger who suggested that the travel and tourism industry was not widely recognized due to its not having any organisation or structure The WTTC was officially established in 1990 The first Annual General Meeting took place in Washington , DC , in 1991 , at which time the Council was composed of 32 members These initial members agreed on the need for a common effort to promote awareness of the economic contribution made by the travel and tourism industry The founding members provided investment and support to produce economic data that could demonstrate the importance of the industry They shared an interest in ensuring greater interest from governments and policy makers in order to facilitate the future success of travel and tourism Robert H Burns took over as Chairman for the WTTC in 1993 , at which time there were 68 members It began releasing tourism impact information around the same time , working with Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates
