The Revised Romanization of Korean \( \) is the official Korean language romanization system in South Korea It was developed by the National Academy of the Korean Language from 1995 and was released to the public on 7 July 2000 by South Korea 's Ministry of Culture and Tourism in Proclamation No 2000 8 The new system corrected problems in the McCune Reischauer system , such as phenomena where different consonants and vowels became indistinguishable in the absence of special symbols To be specific , under the McCune Reischauer system , Korean consonants \( k \) , \( t \) , \( p \) and \( ch \) and \( k' \) , \( t' \) , \( p' \) and \( ch' \) became indistinguishable when the apostrophe was removed In addition , Korean vowels \( \) and \( o \) and \( \) and \( u \) became indistinguishable when the breve was removed Especially in internet use where omission of apostrophes and breves is common , this caused many Koreans as well as foreigners confusion Hence , the revision of the Romanization of Korean was made with the belief that if the old system was left unrevised , it would continue to confuse people , both Koreans and foreigners Features These are notable features of the Revised Romanization system , , , and have been changed from k , t , p , and ch to g , d , b , and j In phonology , g k voice , d t voice , b p voice and j ch voice so more comprehensive g , d , b and j has been assigned to , , and in order to differentiate them from , , and when the apostrophe is removed And the environment in which , , and are pronounced as k , t , p and ch is articulated by the law For example , consonants , , and were decided to be romanized as k , t , p and ch when placed in the final position , as they are neutralized to unreleased stops byeok , bak , bueok , byeoke , bakke , bueoke , keop , , , have been changed from k' , t' , p' and ch' to k , t , p and ch \( removing the apostrophe of the McCune Reischauer system \) Vowels and are written as eo and eu , respectively \( replacing the and of the McCune Reischauer system \) However , is written as wo \( not weo \) , and is written as ui \( not eui \) used to be written as sh and s , depending on context Now it will be written as s in all cases is written as s regardless of the following vowels and semivowels there is no sh sa , si When followed by another consonant or when in final position , it is written as t ot \( but ose \) is r before a vowel or a semivowel and l everywhere else rieul , Cheorwon , Ulleungdo , Balhae Like in McCune Reischauer , is written l whenever pronounced as a lateral rather than as a nasal consonant Jeollabuk do In addition , special provisions are for regular phonological rules in exceptions to transliteration \( see Korean phonology \) Other rules and recommendations include the following A hyphen optionally disambiguates syllables ga eul \( fall autumn \) versus gae ul \( stream \) However , few official publications make use of this provision since actual instances of ambiguity among names are rare A hyphen must be used in linguistic transliterations to denote syllable initial except at the beginning of a word eops eoss seumnida , oegug eo , Ae ogae It is permitted to hyphenate syllables in the given name , following common practice Certain phonological changes , ordinarily indicated in other contexts , are ignored in names , for better disambiguating between names Gang Hongrip or Gang Hong rip \( not Hongnip \) , Han Boknam or Han Bok nam \( not Bongnam or Bong nam \) Administrative units \( such as the do \) are hyphenated from the placename proper Gangwon do One may omit terms such as Pyeongchang gun or Pyeongchang , Pyeongchang eup or Pyeongchang However , names for geographic features and artificial structures are not hyphenated Seoraksan , Haeinsa Proper nouns are capitalized Usage In Korea thumb 250px The sign with the name of the railway station in Bucheon at the top , a writing in hangul ,

Romanization of Korean \( RR , also called South Korean or Ministry of Culture \( MC \) 2000 \) It is estimated to have cost at least 500 billion won to 600 billion won \( US 500 600 million \) to carry out this procedure All Korean textbooks , maps and signs to do with cultural heritage were required to comply with the new system by 28 February 2002 Romanization of surnames and existing companies' names has been left untouched because of the reasons explained below However , the Korean government encourages using the revised romanization of Korean for the new names Exception Like several European languages that have undergone spelling reforms \( such as Portuguese , German or Swedish \) , the Revised Romanization is not expected to be adopted as the official romanization of Korean family names This is because the conditions for allowing changes in romanization of surnames in passport is very strict The reasons are outlined below 1 Countries around the world manage information about foreigners who are harmful to the public safety of their countries , including international criminals and illegal immigrants by the Roman name and date of birth of the passport they have used in the past And if a passport is free to change its Roman name , it will pose a serious risk to border management due to difficulties in determining the same person 2 The people of a country where it is free to change its Roman name will be subject to strict immigration checks , which will inevitably cause inconvenience to the people of that country 3 Arbitrary changes in the Romanization of passports can lead to a fall in the credibility of the passports and national credit , which can have a negative impact on the new visa waiver agreement , etc Also , with very few exceptions , if you have ever left the country under your romanized name , it is impossible to change your family name again However , South Korea 's Ministry of Culture , Sports and Tourism encourages those who newly register their romanized names to follow the Revised Romanization of Korean In addition , North Korea continues to use a version of the McCune Reischauer system of Romanization , a different version of which was in official use in South Korea from 1984 to 2000 Outside Korea Textbooks and dictionaries intended for students of the Korean language tend to include this Romanization However , some publishers have acknowledged the difficulties or confusion it can cause for non native Korean speakers who are unused to the conventions of this style of Romanization Tuttle Publishing In addition , easy to use phonetic spellings of all Korean words and phrases are given For example , How are you \? annyeonghaseyo \? is also written as anh nyawng hah seyo \? , blurb for two Korean
