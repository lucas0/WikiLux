An address is a code and abstract concept expressing the fixed location of a home , business or other building on the earth 's surface Functions Addresses have several functions Providing a means of physically locating a building , especially in a city where there are many buildings and streets , Identifying buildings as the end points of a postal system , A social function someone 's address can have a profound effect on their social standing , As parameters in statistics collection , especially in census taking or the insurance industry History Until the advent of modern postal systems , most houses and buildings were not numbered Streets may have been named for landmarks , such as a city gate or market , or for the professions of their inhabitants In many cities in Asia , most minor streets were never named This is still the case today in much of Japan When postal systems were introduced , it became necessary to number buildings to aid in mail delivery Current addressing schemes House numbering or naming In most English speaking countries the standard is an alternating numbering scheme progressing in one direction along a street , with odd numbers on one side \( usually west or south \) and even numbers on the other \( usually north or east \) , although there is significant variation on this basic pattern Cities in North America , particularly those planned on a grid plan , often incorporate block numbers , quadrants \( explained below \) , and cardinal directions into their street numbers , so that in many such cities , addresses roughly follow a Cartesian coordinate system Some other cities around the world have their own schemes Although house numbering is the principal identification scheme in the British Isles , it is also common for houses there to be identified by name , rather than number , especially in small towns In these cases , the street name will usually follow the house name A fictional example of such an address might read Smith Cottage , Frog Lane , Barchester , Barsetshire , BA9 9BA Quadrants In cities with Cartesian coordinate based addressing systems , the streets that form the north south and east west dividing lines constitute the x and y axes of a Cartesian coordinate plane and thus divide the city into quadrants The quadrants are typically identified in the street names , although the manner of doing so varies from city to city For example , in one city , all streets in the northeast quadrant may have NE prefixed or suffixed to their street names , while in another , the intersection of North Calvert Street and East 27th Street can only be in the northeast quadrant Street naming conventions Street names may follow a variety of themes In many North American cities , such as Manhattan and Edmonton , Alberta , streets are simply numbered sequentially across the street grid Washington , D C has its numbered streets running north south and lettered or alphabetically named streets running east west , while diagonal avenues are typically named after states In Salt Lake City , and many other Utah cities , streets are in a large grid and are numbered in increments of 100 based on their location relative to the center of the city in blocks , these blocks are usually surrounded by wide streets numbered in multiples of 400 A similar system is in use in Detroit with the Mile Road System In some housing developments in North America , streets may all follow the same theme \( for example , bird species \) , or start with the same letter Streets in Continental Europe and Latin America are usually named after famous people or auspicious dates Postal codes Postal codes are a relatively recent development in addressing , designed to speed the sorting and processing of mail by assigning unique numeric or alphanumeric codes to each geographical locality Postal alternatives to physical addresses For privacy and other purposes , postal services have made it possible to receive mail without revealing one 's physical address or even having a fixed physical address Examples are post office boxes and poste restante \( general delivery \) Address format In most of the world , addresses are written in order from most specific to general information , starting with the addressee and ending with the largest geographical unit For example Miss S Pollard 1 Chapel Hill Heswall BOURNEMOUTH BH1 1AAAddressing your mail Guidelines , Royal Mail In English speaking countries , the postal code usually comes last In much of Europe , the code precedes the town name , thus 1010 Lausanne Often , the country code is still placed in front of the postal code CH 1010 Lausanne However , this is no longer recommended by postal authorities If a house number is provided , it is written on the same line as the street name a house name is written on the previous line When addresses are written inline , line breaks are replaced by commas Conventions on the placing of house numbers differ either before or after the street name Similarly , there are differences in the placement of postal codes in the UK , they are written on a separate line at the end of the address in the United States and Canada , they often appear immediately after the state or province , on the same line in Austria , Belgium , Germany and The Netherlands they appear before the city , on the same line The Japanese addressing system uses the opposite ordering , starting with the town and ending with the addressee , except when using the Latin alphabet The Hungarian system also goes from large to small units , except the name of the addressee is put into the first line Geographical address conventions in the media People may be said generally to get used to the form of geographical address used in their home location However , this can cause confusion when people naturally extend their written generalisations from nationally used conventions to media where the audience is global This can be observed most frequently with internet usage , and in films where a scene opens with the location listed on screen For example , it can be guessed that someone writing Birmingham , AL the following would live in the United States of America It is common in the US to include state codes in addresses , but these are often meaningless to persons outside North America who are not accustomed to the US address format In addition , the writer in this example has assumed that others would not only understand from the use of a state code that their city of Birmingham is in the state of Alabama , but also that their city is in the USA Another example of this phenomenon of US address forms being exported to a global audience is with Google Earth This service maps Birmingham to Birmingham , Alabama rather than Birmingham , England , and St Petersburg to St Petersburg , Florida rather than the more populous St Petersburg , Russia Of course , the above phenomenon is not limited to the United States For example , even in media intended for an international audience , it is not uncommon to see a neighborhood in London referred to simply by its London postal district ,
