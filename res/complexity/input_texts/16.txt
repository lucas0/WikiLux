The Germans of Romania or Rum niendeutsche , are an ethnic group of Romania During the interwar period in Romania , the total number of ethnic Germans amounted to as much as 786 , 000 \( according to some sources and estimates dating to 1939 \) , Dr Gerhard Reichning , Die deutschen Vertriebenen in Zahlen , Teil 1 , Bonn 1995 , Page 17Die deutschen Vertreibungsverluste Bev lkerungsbilanzen f r die deutschen Vertreibungsgebiete 1939 50 Herausgeber Statistisches Bundesamt Wiesbaden Stuttgart Verlag W Kohlhammer , 1958 Page 46 a figure which has subsequently fallen to circa 36 , 000 as of 2011 in contemporary Romania Overview and classification thumb 250px right Topographic map of Romania , highlighting the three most important areas of settlement of the Romanian German community Transylvania \( \) , Banat \( \) and Bukovina \( \) The Germans of Romania are not a single , unitary , homogeneous group , but rather a series of different sub groups , each with their own culture , traditions , dialect \( s \) and history This stems from the fact that various German speaking populations arrived on the territory of present day Romania in different waves or stages of settlement , initially as early as the High Middle Ages , firstly to southern and northeastern Transylvania \( some of them even crossing the outer Carpathians to neighbouring Moldavia and Wallachia \) , then subsequently during the Modern Age in other Habsburg ruled lands \( such as Bukovina , at the time part of Cisleithania or Banat \) , as well as in other areas of contemporary Romania \( such as Dobruja \) 250px

political parties which gradually gained parliamentary presence during the early to mid early 20th century , more specifically the Group of Transylvanian Saxons , the German Party , and the German People 's Party \( the latter two having a Fascist political orientation after 1930 \) All those parties are not politically active anymore Instead , the entire German speaking community in post 1989 Romania is represented at official level by the Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania \( , \) The forum is a political platform that has a centrist ideology which aims to support the minority rights of the Germans from Romania Since 1989 , the DFDR FDGR has competed both in local and legislative elections , cooperating in the process with two historical parties of the Romanian politics , namely the National Liberal Party \( PNL \) and the Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party \( PN CD \) , most notably at local administrative level , in cities such as Sibiu \( \) , Timi oara \( \) ,

the German minority in Romania has dwindled in numbers to a considerable extent since the fall of the Iron Curtain , the few but well organised Romanian Germans who decided to remain in the country
