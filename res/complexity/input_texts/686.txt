Rhapsody is an online music service run by RealNetworks Launched in December 2001 , Rhapsody was the first music service to offer streaming on demand access to nearly its entire library of digital music Downloaded files come with restrictions on their use , enforced by Helix , RealNetworks' version of digital rights management History While at TuneTo com in 1999 , Tim Bratton , JP Lester , Sylvain Rebaud , Alexandre Brouaux , Nick Sincaglia and Dave Lampton were working on a streaming audio engine which allowed for remarkably high quality audio streaming This engine was commercially deployed in the TuneTo com customized radio service , and was also used in their celestial jukebox prototype code named Aladdin In April 2001 TuneTo com was acquired by Listen com , a startup founded in San Francisco that had built a massive online music directory The Aladdin prototype was transformed into the Rhapsody music service and was launched in December 2001 It was revolutionary at the time because it was the first streaming on demand music subscription service to offer unlimited access to the entire library of digital music , which at the time was comprised mostly of content from EMI and Naxos Over the next few months content from other major labels was added to the library In July of 2002 Rhapsody became the first on demand music service to offer the complete digital catalogs of all five major record labels of the time \( Sony , EMI , BMG , Universal and Warner \) RealNetworks acquired Listen com on August 3 , 2003 The Rhapsody service was briefly known as RealRhapsody shortly after the acquisition , but has since shortened back to Rhapsody Features Rhapsody exists as two different services with different featuresets , the Rhapsody com streaming service and the Rhapsody Jukebox player Rhapsody has browsing features similar to other competitors , such as the ability to search by Artist , Album , Track , Composer , or Videos , as well as a Keyword search that attempts all of the above Users are also able to browse through links to Artist Influences , Contemporaries , or Related Projects , as well as through multiple Genre hierarchies Purchase Options Rhapsody 's main focus is on an a la carte subscription jukebox model , although it also supports per track purchases There are three main subscription plans Rhapsody 25 , Rhapsody Unlimited , and Rhapsody To Go Rhapsody 25 is free and ad supported version , but only allows 25 free streams per month and access to a few selected radio stations Rhapsody Unlimited is a paid subscription at 9 99
