In ecology , r K selection theory relates to the selection of combinations of traits in an organism that trade off between quantity or quality of offspring The focus upon either increased quantity of offspring at the expense of individual parental investment , or reduced quantity of offspring with a corresponding increased parental investment , is varied to promote success in particular environments The theory was popular in the 1970 's and 1980 's when it was used as a heuristic device , but lost importance in the early 1990 's as it was criticized by several empirical studies The r K selection paradigm has been replaced by a life history paradigm However , this continues to incorporate many of the themes important to the r K paradigm The terminology of r K selection was coined by the ecologists Robert MacArthur and E O WilsonPianka , E R \( 1970 \) On r and K selection American Naturalist 104 , 592 597 based on their work on island biogeography MacArthur , R and Wilson , E

evolution in one of two generalized directions r or K selection These terms , r and K , are drawn from standard ecological algebra , as illustrated in the highly simplified Verhulst equation of population dynamics Verhulst , P F \( 1838 \) Notice sur la loi que la population pursuit dans son accroissement Corresp Math Phys 10 , 113 121 where r is the maximum growth rate of the population \( N \) , and K is the carrying capacity of its local environmental setting As the name implies , r selected species are those that place an emphasis on a high growth rate , and typically exploit less crowded ecological niches and produce many offspring , each of which has a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood \( i e high r , low K \) By contrast , K selected species display traits associated with living at densities close to carrying capacity , and typically are strong competitors in such crowded niches that invest more heavily in fewer offspring , each of which has a relatively high probability of surviving to adulthood \( i e low r , high K \) In the scientific literature , r selected species are occasionally referred to as opportunistic , while K selected species are described as equilibrium For example r selection \( unstable environments \) In unstable or unpredictable environments , r selection predominates as the ability to reproduce quickly is crucial There is little advantage in adaptations that permit successful competition with other organisms , because the environment is likely to change again Traits that are thought to be characteristic of r selection include high fecundity , small body size , early maturity onset , short generation time , and the ability to disperse offspring widely Organisms whose life history is subject to r selection are often referred to as r strategists or r selected Organisms who exhibit r selected traits can range from bacteria and diatoms , to insects and weeds , to various semelparous cephalopods and mammals , particularly small rodents K selection \( stable environments \) In stable or predictable environments , K selection predominates as the ability to compete successfully for limited resources is crucial and populations of K selected organisms typically are very constant and close to the maximum that the environment can bear \( unlike r selected populations , where population sizes can change much more rapidly \) Traits that are thought to be characteristic of K selection include large body size , long life expectancy , and the production of fewer offspring that require extensive parental care until they mature Organisms whose life history is subject to K selection are often referred to as K strategists or K selected Organisms with K selected traits include large organisms such as elephants , trees , humans and whales , but also smaller , long lived organisms such as Arctic Terns r and K selection University of Miami Department of Biology Retrieved February 4 , 2011 As a continuous spectrum Although some organisms are identified as primarily r or K strategists , the majority of organisms do not follow this pattern For instance , trees have traits such as longevity and strong competitiveness that characterise them as K strategists In reproduction , however , trees typically produce thousands of offspring and disperse them widely , traits characteristic of r strategists Similarly , reptiles such as sea turtles display both r and K traits although sea turtles are large organisms with long lifespans \( provided they reach adulthood \) , they produce large numbers of unnurtured offspring Mammalian males tend to be r type reproducers , whereas females tend to have K characteristicsHrdy , Sarah Blaffer \( 2000 \) , Mother Nature Maternal Instincts and How They Shape the Human Species \( Ballantine Books \) In ecological succession In areas of major ecological disruption or sterilisation \( such as after a major volcanic eruption , as at Krakatoa or Mount Saint Helens \) , r and K strategists play distinct roles in the ecological succession that regenerates the ecosystem Because of their higher reproductive rates and ecological opportunism , primary colonisers typically are r strategists and they are followed by a succession of increasingly competitive flora and fauna The ability of an environment to increase energetic content , through photosynthetic capture of solar energy , increases with the increase in complex biodiversity as r species proliferate to reach a peak possible with K strategies Gunderson , L Holling , C S \( Eds \) \( 2001 \) , Panarchy Understanding Transformations in Human and Natural Systems \( Island Press \) Eventually a new equilibrium is approached \( sometimes referred to as a climax community \) , with r strategists gradually being replaced by K strategists which are more competitive and better adapted to the emerging micro environmental characteristics of the landscape Traditionally , biodiversity was considered maximized at this stage , with introductions of new species resulting in the replacement and local extinction of endemic species McNeely , J A \( 1994 \)

create patches at different levels of succession , promoting coexistence of colonizers and competitors at the regional scale Status of the theory In the 1970s and 1980s , several studies failed to produce experimental corroboration of the r K theory , and , as a result , r K selection theory was discarded by biologists studying life history evolution by the early nineties Graves , Joseph L The
