restrictive immigration policy \( with the exception of the highly skilled \) and the reduction of state welfare benefits There were severe reactions to his statements on economic and immigration policy in Berlin , which were published in September 2009 in Lettre International , a German cultural quarterly In it he described many Arab and Turkish immigrants as unwilling to integrate He said , among other things Integration requires effort from those that are to be integrated I will not show respect for anyone that is not making that effort I do not have to acknowledge anyone who lives by welfare , denies the legitimacy of the very state that provides that welfare , refuses to care for the education of his children and constantly produces new little headscarf girls thumb 140px Sarrazin 's controversial book He has also said regarding Islam , No other religion in Europe makes so many demands No immigrant group other than Muslims is so strongly connected with claims on the welfare state and crime No group emphasizes their differences so strongly in public , especially through women s clothing In no other religion is the transition to violence , dictatorship and terrorism so fluid Bild newspaper Sarrazin 's statements were criticized by the chairman of the Interior Committee of the German Bundestag , Sebastian Edathy \( SPD \) , the ver di union and the political scientist Gerd Wiegel Arno Widmann , culture editor of the Frankfurter Rundschau , wrote He reacted hysterically to the change in conditions of West Germany He 's crazy Sarrazin 's book Deutschland schafft sich ab Germany Does Away With Itself or Germany Abolishes Itself , presented at the end of August 2010 , came under criticism for claiming that Germany 's immigrant Muslim population is reluctant to integrate and tends to rely more on social services than to be productive Furthermore , he calculates that their population growth may well overwhelm the German population within a couple of generations at the current rate , and that their intelligence is lower as well He proposes stringent reforms for the welfare system to rectify the problems The first edition of his book sold out within a few days By the end of the year , the book had become Germany 's number 1 hard cover non fiction bestseller for the year and was still at the top of the lists An uproar was caused at the same time by an interview with Welt am Sonntag in which he claimed that all Jews share a certain gene like all Basques share a certain gene that distinguishes these from other people He subsequently offered his regrets for the irritation caused and explained his source , for instance , in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , referring to international media reports on a recent study by Gil Atzmon et al that appeared in the American Journal of Human Genetics In 2009 , however , he described the Nazi extermination of Jews as an enormous intellectual bloodletting , a loss which he claimed Germany in general , and Berlin in particular , has never recovered from The party leadership of the Social Democratic Party \( SPD Germany 's main center left party \) then announced it will investigate whether to terminate Sarrazin 's membership , because allegedly his theses are diametrical to basic social democratic values SPD Website His statements have drawn criticism as well from across the political spectrum in Germany , despite polls suggesting that almost half of the population \( including SPD members \) agree with his views and even 18 percent would vote for his party if he started one Berliner Morgenpost Statements of support Others have however argued that in Germany freedom of speech is being lost , as pressure to conform to certain viewpoints is suppressing and silencing other opinions Volker Kastrow in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung makes the comparison between the huge pressure and possibly illegal measures to remove Sarrazin from his job and his party with the furore over the statements made , in private but leaked , by Erika Steinbach , who had referred to what she claims is a fact of history \( that the Polish military started mobilising itself against Germany in March 1939 \) , which is apparently not an opinion allowed in Germany , seemingly because it echoes one of the justifications made by the Nazis in 1939 for starting the war , and thus suggests that Germany may be less culpable over World War II Steinbach has been forced out of her role in the CDU political party , even though she has said that the fact of the date of Polish mobilisation does not take away Germany 's war guilt Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung Daily Telegraph While Turkish and Islamic organizations have accused Sarrazin of racism and damaging Germany s reputation abroad , the prominent German Turkish sociologist and best selling author Necla Kelek , who has defended Sarrazin , introduced him at a Berlin press conference in late August 2010 attended by roughly 300 journalists , as big a turn out as for the Chancellor Angela Merkel s rare press appearances Kelek said Sarrazin addressed bitter truths in his new book and the chattering classes have judged it without reading it BBC Henryk Broder , the Spiegel newsweekly commentator , offered an explanation for attacks on Sarrazin s statements And there s a second trick that s being used now he s being accused of anti Semitism If you could accuse him of anything , it s philo Semitism , because he wrongly thinks Jews are more intelligent than others , Broder said He added , But of course , with an anti Semitism accusation you can really go after someone , because anti Semitism of course is no longer acceptable in Germany , and rightly so There is no substantive debate here at all the issue is that a nation gets up , as it were , they all agree and they take it all out on a scapegoat who they d like to send into the desert It s very disturbing Spiegel TV Political correctness is silencing an important debate said Matthias Matussek of Der Spiegel magazine Sarrazin 's findings on the failed integration of Turkish and Arab immigrants are beyond any doubt He has been forced out of the Bundesbank The SPD wants to kick him out of the party , too Invitations previously extended to Sarrazin are being withdrawn The culture page editors at the German weekly Die Zeit are crying foul and the editors at the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung are damning Sarrazin for passages he did n't even write But what all these technicians of exclusion fail to see is that you cannot cast away the very thing that Sarrazin embodies the anger of people who are sick and tired after putting a long and arduous process of Enlightenment behind them of being confronted with pre Enlightenment elements that are returning to the center of our society They are sick of being cursed or laughed at when they offer assistance with integration And they are tired about reading about Islamist associations that have one degree of separation from terrorism , of honor killings , of death threats against cartoonists and filmmakers Der Spiegel Klaus von Dohnanyi , who offered to defend Sarrazin as the SPD seeks to expel him , told the S ddeutsche Zeitung newspaper how Germany was overshadowed by its Holocaust history and how a culture had developed whereby anyone saying the words gene or Jew is automatically considered suspect He complains that we shy away from debates that are commonplace in other countries Among those is the discussion that specific ethnic groups share specific characteristics S ddeutsche Zeitung References External links Interview with Thilo Sarrazin on the BBC show World Have Your Say Volkmar Weiss Review of Sarrazin 's book 'Germany Does Away With Itself'
