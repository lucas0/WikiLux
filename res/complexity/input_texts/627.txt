Map a University is also the first Philippine and Southeast Asian educational institution to have ABET certification History Early activities The institute was founded on January 25 , 1925 , by Ar Tom s B Map a , a graduate of Cornell University and the first registered Filipino architect and Civil Engr Gonzalo T Vales At first , the institute only provided architecture and civil engineering programs It is the first institution in the Philippines to offer a bachelor 's degree in architecture There were 80 students and a dozen faculty members at that time classes were held in a rented commercial building in Carriedo Street near Feati University in Quiapo , Manila In 1928 , the Map a Institute of Technology Pre Engineering High School was established in Doroteo Jose Street \( now present site of Amaia Skies Tower Avenida developed by Ayala Group \) through Rizal Avenue Sta Cruz Manila Then in 1930 , Map a joined the National Collegiate Athletic Association as the Map a Cardinals World War II and after war development During World War II , Map a 's Intramuros Campus was used as a garrison by the Japanese forces during the occupation of Manila , and all classes and organisations were suspended The Institute would continue to suffer throughout the war as the effort of the Institute to continue the studies of the students were suspended and Senior students were forced to prematurely graduate In 1945 the Institute suffered total destruction during the liberation As a part of the rehabilitation program , the former De Luxe Fashion School in Doroteo Jos was Leased Lot property for 50 years \( 1948 1998 \) and housed the high school department in 1948 In 1951 , the Don Tomas B Map a family acquired a piece of land from the La Corporaci n Fransicana where the present Intramuros Campus stands The campus opened at 1956 and the building construction was completed in 1963 All college programs under deanship of Engr Gonzalo T Vales were transferred from the Doroteo Jos campus to the Intramuros Campus in 1973 Ar Tomas B Map a died on December 22 , 1965 and his son scar Sr took over the presidency until his death in 1998 It was under Ar T mas B Map a , and later his son scar Sr , that the institute gained prominence as an engineering school During this period , the institute took the top 10 and even the top 20 slots in most licensure exams for architecture and engineering It also achieved the highest passing rates in the board exams among other competing schools in architecture and engineering Yuchengco administration Ar Tom s B Map a 's grandson , Ar Oscar Map a Jr , took over his uties until December 1999 , when the Map a family sold the institute to the Yuchengco Group of Companies \( YGC \) headed by Alfonso T Yuchengco and appointed Reynaldo B Vea as president In 2002 , the old RCBC Building in Sen Gil Puyat Ave in Makati City was purchased and converted into the Map a Makati Campus , where the School of Information Technology was moved from the Intramuros Campus A spin off of the School of IT , the Map a IT Center , as the Makati Campus is named , was established The MITC offers 2 year diploma programs that eventually lead into an associate degree ladderized to the bachelor 's degree \( 4 year \) IT courses of Map a Starting 2002 , Map a , which originally was on a semestral system , adopted the quartem system This academic system was intended to allow students to graduate faster \( e g the original 5 year engineering programs could be taken in four years \) and to focus on less , interrelated course subjects in an 11 week term On the other hand , Map a High School was closed down on 2005 , since it was operated in the red Along with the establishment of the Malayan High School of Science and Malayan Colleges Laguna , the Administration intends to encompass all its educational institutions under the name Malayan Colleges , to be later pushed through to university status as is under the Vision 2020 initiative with Map a Institute of Technology as the College of Engineering On May 18 , 2017 , Map a Institute of Technology has been formally granted University Status , per Commission en banc Resolution No 379 2017 , dated May 9 , 2017 at the CHED Auditorium in Diliman , Quezon City On January 8 , 2018 , Yuchengco Group of Companies and Ayala Corporation , through a joint press

in the Philippines Malayan controversy On February 10 , 2005 , as a part of Map a 's plans for elevating the institute to university status , the administration announced the renaming of the institute to Malayan University , inspired by the name of the insurance company owned by the Yuchengcos , the Malayan Insurance Company But while waiting to become eligible for university status , the name Malayan Colleges will be used and the name Map a Institute of Technology will be retained for the College of Engineering , Architecture and IT This move was very unpopular with the students and the alumni On February 14 , 2005 , the students protested outside the campus , clad in black shirts protesting against the decision of the administration and criticized them for not consulting the students before making such a decision This event has been called as the Black Valentine protest Despite the efforts of the students , faculty and alumni against the decision , the Board of Trustees and the Commission on Higher Education \( CHED Philippines \) have approved the name change and will be implemented in the near future Notable Map ans References Mapua Category Research universities
