One is the third single from U2 's 1991 album , Achtung Baby , and was released in 1992 It is widely considered to be one of the band 's greatest songs and is consistently featured in lists of the greatest songs of all time The song was a top ten hit on UK and US charts and reached the top of the US Modern Rock Tracks chart History During the recording of Achtung Baby , tensions in the band began to rise over the direction of the album Bono and The Edge favored electronica and dance music explorations , while Larry Mullen Jr and Adam Clayton preferred otherwise U2 was on the brink of breaking up when the band rallied around a riff The Edge was trying to write for the bridge of Ultraviolet \( Light My Way \) It inspired the band to write One , and it changed the band 's outlook on the album , helping bring a renewed sense of optimism towards the material they had already recorded Leaving Berlin on a high note , the band was able to complete the rest of the album in Dublin For this reason it is widely considered , by the band and fans , to be the song that saved U2 Meaning One has many debated meanings The ambiguity is likely the main aspect that popularizes the song , allowing for many different interpretations At its most basic level the song is about two people who love each other , yet cause each other great pain This theme perhaps stems from Bono 's relationship with his father following the death of his mother when he was 14 , which leads some fans to believe that One is a personal account of that time In an interview on All That You Ca n't Leave Behind , Bono said on writing the lyrics for One I had a lot of things going on in my head at the time , about forgiveness , about father and son angst Song Meanings But it is just as likely that Bono was drawing on those emotions to paint a more non autobiographical picture In 1993 , speaking to Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times , Bono offered a more ambiguous meaning to the lyrics , saying It is a song about coming together , but it 's not the old hippie idea of 'Let 's all live together ' It is , in fact , the opposite It 's saying , We are one , but we 're not the same It 's not saying we even want to get along , but that we have to get along together in this world if it is to survive It 's a reminder that we have no choice There were 3 videos made for the song which adds to the discussions One of them suggests that One is about a gay son confessing to his father that he is HIV positive largely assumed because of the content of director Anton Corbijn 's video , in which the band dressed in drag and Bono sings the song to his own father It is filmed in Berlin and has footage of the band driving in Trabant cars Also , a large amount of sales from the single went to AIDS charities Another video has footage of blooming flowers and buffaloes , interspersed with numerous black title cards featuring the word one in white lettering , depicted in numerous languages The buffaloes in the video originate from a photo by David Wojnarowicz , a gay artist who died of AIDS Whirlpool James Out To Get You The photo is on the cover of the single Yet another version of the video shows Bono in a bar , smoking a cheroot and drinking beer Answers Yahoo Best Answer The Edge in Q magazine said , I often come across people who 've told me they played it at their wedding , And I think , 'Have you listened to the lyrics \? It 's not that kind of a song' U2 MOL One Others interpret the song as achieving oneness in the spiritual sense , while yet another point of view suggests that it 's about the reunification of East and West Germany and the subsequent , slow healing of past wounds as the Berlin Wall collapses This particular one is popular due to the time the band spent in Germany during the album 's creation
