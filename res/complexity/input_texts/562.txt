Elimination communication \( EC \) is a toilet training practice in which a caregiver uses timing , signals , cues , and intuition to address an infant 's need to eliminate waste Typically the goal is to partially or completely avoid the use of diapers EC emphasizes communication between the caregiver and child , helping them both become more attuned to the child 's innate rhythms and control of urination and defecation The term elimination communication was inspired by traditional practices of diaper less baby care in less industrialized countries and hunter gatherer cultures Practicing Elimination Communication DiaperFreeBaby Some practitioners of EC begin soon after birth , although it can be started with babies of any age Origins The terms elimination communication and natural infant hygiene were coined by Ingrid Bauer and are used interchangeably in her book , Diaper Free ! The Gentle Wisdom of Natural Infant Hygiene \( 2001 \) Bauer had traveled to India and Africa , where she noticed that most mothers would carry their diaperless babies constantly , yet she saw no elimination accidents as would be expected in industrialized countries where babies wear diapers almost continuously from birth Subsequently , she raised her own children with minimal use of diapers , and eventually began to share her approach with other mothers and caregivers initially through Internet based parenting support groups and eventually through her book and website \( link missing \) Prior publications introducing Western parents to this ancient practice include the booklet Conscious Toilet Training , by Laurie Boucke \( 1979 \) , book Trickle Treat Diaperless Infant Toilet Training Method , by Laurie Boucke \( 1991 \) , a pamphlet entitled Elimination Timing , by Natec \( 1994 \) , and the more extensive Infant Potty Training A Gentle and Primeval Method Adapted to Modern Living , by Laurie Boucke \( 2000 \) Boucke was influenced by an Indian friend who taught her how mothers in India care for babies without diapers , and she adapted it to fit her Western lifestyle Boucke later co produced an in depth DVD entitled Potty Whispering The Gentle Practice of Infant Potty Training \( 2006 \) and co authored articles for medical journals Search for medical journal articles by Boucke et al While the terms elimination communication and infant potty training have become synonymous , many caregivers who practice EC do not consider it to be a form of training , per se EC is viewed primarily as a way to meet the baby 's present needs and to enhance attachment and communication in general In that sense , EC is often likened to breastfeeding Toilet mastery is , of course , an inevitable consequence , writes Bauer , Yet it 's no more the goal of Natural Infant Hygiene than weaning is the goal of breastfeeding \( 2001 , p 217 \) Today , one often hears the terms natural infant hygiene , infant potty training , and potty whispering used synonymously Benefits According to The Diaper Free Baby by Christine Gross Loh , EC offers a large range of advantages Because EC lessens families' reliance on diapers , this helps reduce the number of diapers sent to landfill , and is cheaper ECed babies are free from the problems of conventional diapering

unique and wonderful bond between parents and caregivers The Diaper Free Baby by Christine Gross Loh \( Los Angeles Regan , 2007 \) Criticisms EC is a little known about method \( in the West \) that is generally only found in minority parenting groups The vast majority of parents in the West have limited access to information about or support for this technique Conventional potty training advice is based on the research by T Berry Brazelton who introduced the idea of the readiness approach He writes that widespread acceptance of readiness and independent toileting have since been supported by clinical experience and resulted in agreement that a child should be ready to participate in toilet training at approximately 18 months of age and be trained completely by 2 or 3 years old He argues that trying to toilet train before this age could be coercive and therefore psychologically damaging Instruction , Timeliness , and Medical Influences Affecting Toilet Training by T Berry Brazelton , MD et al Brazelton acknowledges that EC is both possible and desirable , but he believes it is difficult to perform in Western society In particular he cites a mother 's return to work as an obstacle to EC He also argues that parents should not be made to feel guilty if they cannot communicate with their babies in this way Desert News Archives A new old way to toilet train baby , by Berry Brazelton and Sparrow Anecdotal evidence from parents suggest that EC is not as convenient as conventional diapering http groups yahoo com group eliminationcommunication yahoo group supporting parents who EC Components The main components of EC are timing , signals , cueing , and intuition Timing Timing refers to identifying the infant 's natural timing of elimination Newborns tend to urinate every 10 20 minutes , sometimes very regularly , which makes timing extremely useful Older babies may still be very regular , or may vary in timing based on when they have last eaten or slept As infants get older , the time between eliminations will increase By six months , it is not uncommon for babies to go as much as an hour without urinating while awake \( babies , like adults , rarely urinate during a deep sleep \) Timing varies radically for defecation , as some infants may have several bowel movements a day , while others may only have one every few days \( Some doctors would consider the latter to be a sign of problems , usually with diet , such as not breast feeding , the breast feeding mother 's dietary problems , dehydration , problems with the formula the baby is given , or possibly emotional problems , such as much stress in the home \) Signals Signals are the baby 's way of informing a caregiver of an elimination need Some babies signal very clearly from the beginning , while others may have very subtle signals , or no signal at all These signals vary widely from one infant to another , and include a certain facial expression , a particular cry , squirming , a sudden unexplained fussiness , as well as others Babies who are nursing will often start delatching and relatching repeatedly when they need to eliminate For defecation , many babies will grunt or pass gas as a signal Older babies can learn a gesture or baby sign for potty Cueing Cueing consists of the caregiver making a particular sound or other cue when the baby is in an appropriate place to urinate or defecate , in order to develop two way communication At first , the caregiver can make the cueing sound when the baby is eliminating , to develop an association Once the association is established , the cue can be used to indicate to the baby that he or she is in an appropriate potty place This is especially useful for infants who may not recognize public toilets or unfamiliar receptacles as a potty Common sound cues include psss psss for urination , and hmm hmm \( grunting \) for defecation Older babies \( late starters \) may respond better to more word like cues Cues do not have to be auditory Intuition Intuition refers to a caregiver 's unprompted thought that the baby may need to eliminate Although much intuition may simply be subconscious awareness of timing or signals , many parents who practice EC find it an extremely reliable component See also Attachment parenting Infant potty training method Dunstan Baby Language Toilet training References External
