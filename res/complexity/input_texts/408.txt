Tyrol is a region in Western Central Europe , which included the present day Austrian state of Tyrol \( consisting of North Tyrol and East Tyrol \) , the Italian region Trentino Alto Adige S dtirol and three communes of the Italian region Veneto \( Livinallongo del Col di Lana , Colle Santa Lucia e Cortina d'Ampezzo \) History Prehistory Historically the region was home to a series of autochthonous cultures occupying roughly the area of the later county of Tyrol The most prominent are the late Bronze Age Laugen Melaun Luco Meluno and Iron Age Fritzens Sanzeno cultures The Laugen Melaun Luco Meluno culture , named after two important archaeological sites near the modern day town of Brixen \( Bressanone \) in Bolzano Bozen , appears in the 14th century BC in the area of today 's Bolzano Bozen and Trento , while the northern part of Tyrol comes under the influence of the Urnfield CultureGleirscher 1992 It is characterized by a particular type of richly decorated pottery , while the metal working is strongly influenced by adjacent cultures The people of the Laugen Melaun Luco Meluno culture cremated the dead and placed their ashes in urns , and worshipped their gods in sanctuaries sometimes placed in remote areas , on mountain tops or close to water Around 500 BC the Fritzens Sanzeno culture , also known as culture of the Rhaetics , after the goddess Rhaetia who according to roman authors was the main deity of the people inhabiting the region , succeeds both the Laugen Melaun Luco Meluno culture of the southern and the Urnfield culture of the northern part of Tyrol Gleirscher 1991 As in the preceding culture , the richly ornamented pottery is very characteristic , while many aspects such as the metal working , burial customs and religion are strongly influenced by its neighbours , mainly the Etruscans and Celts Nonetheless , the Fritzens Sanzeno people possessed important cultural traits which clearly distinguish them from adjacent groups , such as the typical mountain sanctuaries already in use during the time of the Laugen Melaun Luco Meluno Culture , certain types of fibulae , bronze armor , and an own alphabet derived from the Etruscan Antiquity In 15 BCE the region was conquered by the Romans and its northern and eastern part were incorporated into the Roman Empire as the provinces of Raetia and Noricum respectively , while the part south of and including the area around the modern day cities of Merano and Bolzano became part of Italia 's Regio X As in the rest of Europe , the Roman era left deep marks in the culture and in the language \( see Rhaeto Romance languages \) According to a more recent and controversial theory , the Rhaeto Romance languages are autochthonous and date back to before the Roman conquest \( see Paleolithic Continuity Theory \) Middle Ages and early modern era From the 5th to the 6th century it was part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom And after its fall in 553 to the 9th century , the region was settled by the Bavarii and the Langobards As part of the Frankish Empire and later the Holy Roman Empire the region had a strategic importance as a bridgehead to Italy as the southern part of the duchy of Bavaria Tyrol , incorporated into the southern part of the Duchy of Bavaria during the Early Middle Ages , consisted largely of ecclesiastical holdings of the Bishops of Brixen and Trento Over the centuries , the Counts residing in Castle Tyrol , near Merano , extended their territory over much of the region and came to surpass the power of the bishops , who were nominally their feudal lords Later counts came to hold much of their territory directly from the Holy Roman Emperor The Meinhardinger family , originating in Gorizia , held not only Tyrol and Gorizia , but for a time also the Duchy of Carinthia 1363 1369 the Wittelsbach released the country for Habsburg when Margarete Maultasch , lacking any descendants to succeed her , bequeathed Tyrol to Duke Rudolph IV of House of Habsburg From that time onwards , Tyrol was ruled by various lines of the Habsburg family , who held the title of the Count of Tyrol \( see List of rulers of Austria \) The red eagle in Tyrol 's coat of arms is derived from the red Brandenburg eagle at the time when Louis V , Duke of Bavaria and Margarete Maultasch governed Brandenburg as well Napoleonic Wars and 19th century Following defeat by Napoleon in 1805 , Austria was forced to cede Tyrol to the Kingdom of Bavaria in the Peace of Pressburg Tyrol as a part of Bavaria became a member of the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 The Tyroleans , known to be an obstinate and proud people , rose up against the Bavarian authority and succeeded twice in defeating Bavarian and French troops trying to retake the country Austria lost the war of the Fifth Coalition against France , and got even harsher terms in the Treaty of Sch nbrunn in 1809 Often glorified as Tyrol 's national hero , Andreas Hofer , the leader of the uprising , was executed in 1810 in Mantua , having lost a third and final battle against the French and Bavarian forces Tyrol remained divided under Bavarian and Italian authority for another four years before being reunified and returned to Austria following the decisions at the Congress of Vienna in 1814 Integrated into the Austrian Empire , from 1867 onwards it was a Kronland Crown Land of Cisleithania , the western half of Austria Hungary World War I thumb 200px The former Tyrol today \( excluding Cortina and Livinallongo \) On the eve of World War I the Austrian crownland of Tyrol included an area populated mainly by Italian speakers , which coincided roughly with the present day Province of Trento The linguistic border was well defined and followed the border between South Tyrol and Trento at the Salurn PassAlcock 1996 , p 67 The existence of areas largely populated by Italian speaking populations under the rule of the Austrian Empire was a constant cause of friction between Austria and Italy , a national state set on the unification of all Italians Being part of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria was an embarrassment , if not a contraddiction for ItalyAlcock 1996 , p 67 Italy 's fear that it would not get what it wanted in case of a victorious Triple Alliance made it remain neutral during the first year of the war , and the preoccupation that it would n't get what it wanted from a victorious Entente either if it remained neutral led it to join the war on the side of the latterAlcock 1996 , p 67 Italy conducted intense negotiations with Austria , which was prepared to part with Trento in exchange of Italy 's neutrality , but Italy wanted the old borders of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy , which ran between Salurn and the Brenner Pass , a demand which Austria refused , since it would mean giving up a territory regarded as personal fief by the Habsburg Emperors From the Entente Italy demanded the boundary at the Brenner Pass in order to change Alliances On 26th April 1915 Italy signed the London Pact , in which it accepted to declare war against the Central Powers , in exchange for the unredeemed territories of Trentino , Gorizia , Trieste and Dalmatia as well as the part of German Tyrol south of the main Alpine divideAlcock 1996 , p 68 Apart from these territorial gains the change of alliance enabled Italy to gain what it really aspired to Italian military dominance in the MediterraneanRusconi 2005 , p 127 128 The ideals of irredentism where used to convince the population of the necessity of the war , but the true motives of the political leadership to join the war was their idea that Italy should become a great European powerRusconi 2005 , p 184 185 The war against the Austro Hungarian Empire was declared on May 24 , 1915 This put Tyrol on the front line , which passed through some of the highest mountains in the Alps The ensuing front became known as the War in ice and snow , as troops occupied the highest mountains and glaciers all year long Twelve metres \( 40 feet \) of snow were a usual occurrence during the winter of 1915 16 and tens of thousands of soldiers disappeared in avalanches The remains of these soldiers are still being uncovered today The Italian Alpini , as well as their Austrian counterparts \( Kaiserj ger , Standsch tzen and Landessch tzen \) and the German Alpenkorps occupied every hill and mountain top and began to carve extensive fortifications and military quarters , even drilling tunnels inside the mountains and deep into glaciers , like at Marmolada Guns were dragged by hundreds of troops on mountains up to 3 , 890 m \( 12 , 760 ft \) Streets , cable cars , mountain railways and walkways through the steepest of walls were built But whoever had occupied the higher ground first was almost impossible to dislodge , so both sides turned to drilling tunnels under mountain peaks , filling them up with explosives and then detonating the whole mountain to pieces , including its defenders , such us Col di Lana , Monte Pasubio , Lagazuoi , etc Climbing and skiing became essential skills for the troops of both sides and soon Ski Battalions and Special Climbing units were formed On May 15 , 1916 , the Austrian army staged an attack from the Trentino without the aid of the German army , whose command had advised against such a move In order to achieve the necessary troop strength , several divisions where withdrawn from the Russian front The offensive was only a limited tactical success The Austrians penetrated twelve miles into Italian territory and inflicted heavy casualties on the Italians , but fell short of their strategic and political goalsRothenberg 1977 , p 79 80 This inconclusive attack weakened the eastern front , which enabled the Russian Army to overrun Austrian positions in Galicia and threaten the heart of the Habsburg EmpireRothenberg 1977 , p 80 Until the end of the war the Tyrolean frontline remained practically unchanged The decisive battles where fought elsewhere This changed after the Battle of Vittorio Veneto , which caused the collapse of the imperial army and its end as a combat force First World War com Battles The Battle of Vittorio Veneto , 1918 \( see Battle of Vittorio Veneto \) The Armistice of Villa Giusti was consequently signed on the 3rd of November 1918 , but was set to come into force only the day after , the 4th November 1915 , at 3pm , with Italians troops already penetrated in the Tyrolean territory After the 27th of November , being the Imperial Army already in a full retreatHerwig 1997 , p 438 Italian troops find nearly no resistance Pasquali 2007 , p 109 In its advance , Italian troops took roughly 350 , 000 to 400 , 000 fleeing Austro Hungarian soldiers prisoner in the space of 36 hoursHerwig 1997 , p 438 It appears that this was also due to the fact that the Austrian command had decided that captivity in Italy was preferable to starvation at homeRothenberg 1976 , p 218 After the armistice , hundreds of thousands Austrian soldiers without weapons , food and discipline made their way home through the alpine valleys The alpine villages where caught between the retreating , half starved soldiers who repeatedly resorted to theft and robbery to survive , and the advancing Italian army At the same time , great numbers of Italian war prisoners where making their way south towards their homeland Austria did not have the means to guarantee the orderly retreat of its own army or the organized return of Italian war prisonersPasquali 2007 , p 113 300px right thumb Battle of Vittorio Veneto In the meantime , Italian occupation of Tyrol was going as planned On the 11th September Italian troops occupied the Brenner Pass and the Pass at Toblach In order to secure access to the Inn valley , crucial for an advance into southern Germany , Innsbruck , the capital of Tyrol , and the village Landeck where occupied as well On 10 January 1919 the commander of the 3rd army corps , gen Ugo Sani , was appointed military governor of northern Tyrol with residence in InnsbruckPasquali 2007 , p 113 The division of Tyrol The Italian victory in the battle of Vittorio Veneto determined the final collapse of the Austro Hungarian Empire , and led to the end of the First World War on the Italian Front , fastening the surrendering of Germany , unable to sustain a new front line in the South The Treaty of Saint Germain ruled that , according to the London Pact , the southern part of Tyrol had to be ceded to Italy , granting Italy the right to push its border northward to the strategically important Alpine water divide The northern was ceded to the First Austrian Republic Other facts Today Tyrolean lands are known for some of the finest snow skiing in Europe Some famous resorts in the Tyrolean Alps include Kitzb hel , Wilder Kaiser , Ischgl , and St Anton , home of the world 's first ski school founded by Hannes Schneider The Tyrol Gr stl is a traditional food which contains
