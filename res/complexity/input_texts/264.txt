Gibson Bend of the Missouri River is a meander located in Pottawattamie County , Iowa and Douglas County , Nebraska , located at References The Gibson Bend of the Missouri River is located at Omaha Nebraska about where Hascall Street would intersect the river The Gibson yards of the Burlington Northern is also located at this bend in the river on the bottoms In 1952 the flood was contained by the dike built there from soil taken out of the hills behind the roundhouse of the Burlington , so the dirt they contained is now the dike The interstate eventually went over the Missouri River at that point , exactly ten miles above the Platte river and Lewis and Clark placed mounds on their maps and mention them in the journals at that point They said a few dozen Indian Mounds in the area covered a location of about two hundred acres Clark drew these on his map with x 's and triangles suggesting it was the site of an ancient village of the Otoes and some of the crew swam the horses over and examined them for a day The dirt in the area is no doubt glacial deposits and those mounds probably buit up by some action of the river , and glacier or something else rather than having been built entirely by the natives , although they may have been groomed by them somewhat for funeral purposes as they did in other areas of the country and the journals mention this also Three of the mounds that were at Gibson can be seen on aerial photo from 1938 of the area at HistoricAerials com ask for 1st and Hascall streets , they are just behind the railroad roundhouse Government aerial pictures from the forties and fifties of the area clearly show mounds at Gibson , along the hillside , and of unusual height , more than fifty feet or so , and of such an angle that they would be almost impossible to climb without assistance of some kind There was a house between these mounds and when the mounds were taken down it was removed They were heavily saturated with sand and the ground up rock \( loess \) from the glacier and dirt , but very few small river rock pebbles of differing colors , not common to the area , again suggesting the glacier Some of the locals called these Camel 's Humps and they certainly looked like that The Missouri river was a fickle river indeed and the old channels on the Iowa side depict this tendency to meander at its own will , a row of many old channel beds are there just across the river in Iowa and these in the heat of summer blister up into hard clay like gulches But in other seasons they are a bog , moistened by the river they are gumbo turning into an almost quicksand type substance to pull you down if you jump on it a few times Clark placed a lake just south of Gibson on the river bottom he called spring lake with jagged edges suggesting small mounds in that area also This lake was fed by several springs coming out of the high bank to the west with one or two egress back into the river , the lake was large on the north end tapering off at the other A small neighborhood in the 1950 's called Gibson was located between the humps and this lake mostly on the hills consisting of about eighty homes A beanery , several other homes a grain elevator and the railroad shops of the Burlington Northern were on the river bottom The railroad cut through the face of one of the mounds on its way north to the yards at the Burlington and Union Pacific stations in Omaha Gibson was boardered on the East by the river and the West by Riverview Blvd the North by Bancroft street and the South by Grover street The present Henry Doorley Zoo resides right up to Gibson on the Southwest The infamous riot of 1919 in which the mayor was hung , the courthouse burned and a young black man lynched started in Gibson External links http historicomaha com http nebraskastudies org http gutenberg org Lewis and Clark journals Pottawattamie County , Iowa Douglas County , Nebraska Category Pottawattamie County , Iowa Category Douglas County , Nebraska Category Missouri River Category Rivers of Iowa Category Rivers of Nebraska
