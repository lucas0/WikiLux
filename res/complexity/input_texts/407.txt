international representative prop forward , he previously played for the Penrith Panthers , with whom he won the 2003 premiership Playing career Before joining the Penrith club , Clinton played for the Parramatta Eels Rising to prominence in in the Panthers' successful 2003 season , he helped the Panthers come from last place in 2001 to become Minor Premiers and eventual premiers in 2003 That year Clinton was rewarded for his form with test selection for Australia , describing the experience as a great personal bonus but it did not compare to winning the premiership with the guys you train and play with all year long Clinton 's good form continued into 2004 and he was selected in the Australian team that took on the Kiwis in the annual ANZAC Test His performance on debut was highly rated by rugby league experts , so it came as a shock to many when Joel was overlooked for selection for NSW in all three games of the 2004 State of Origin series 2006 season The Panther 's first loss of the 2006 season came against the Raiders , a close , golden point match During the game , Clinton was hit by a high tackle from Raiders hooker Simon Woolford Clinton received a black eye , but got up off the ground smiling , and continued playing Clinton 's ability to brush off the hit left Woolford claiming the high tackle was n't that serious These comments left Clinton steaming , saying Woolford should learn to keep his mouth shut In May 2006 , Clinton was selected to trial for the New South Wales State of Origin team in the Country v City game Clinton played for City , and before the game commented that he intended to smash his way into the NSW side Clinton saved a try in the first 20 minutes , diving on a cross kick into the in goal by Country City eventually lost by 2 points , conceding tries while Clinton was off the field thumb 280px right Joel Clinton hits the Warriors' line in Round 21 of the 2006 season Manly five eighth Travis Burns branded Joel Clinton as childish and a bad sport for allegedly squirting him with a water bottle while lining up a match winning penalty goal in Round 20 \( 23 July 2006 \) Viewing the replay , it appears that Clinton was standing over 10 metres away from Burns , leading Coach John Lang to comment it must 've been a bloody big squirt 'That Tackle' In Round 19 , 15 July 2006 , Joel Clinton made international headlines with a tackle on Ty Williams of the North Queensland Cowboys With the Penrith Panthers ahead 12 8 Cowboys winger Ty Williams broke the Panthers line and headed for a runaway try in the corner However , Clinton had enough pace and tenacity to pull the Queensland Origin player into touch just centimetres out from the tryline Considered one of the fastest men in the NRL over one hundred metres , Williams was running for a game changing four points Instead , Clinton single handedly reversed the momentum of the match This allowed Panthers winger Michael Gordon to score in the final minute , giving the Panthers an unlikely 17 8 win 2007 season Pre Season Fresh from the off season under new coach Matthew Elliott , Clinton said that confidence within the Panthers team was high for 2007 Blokes like me , Trent Waterhouse and Luke Lewis have taken on a leadership role this year , Clinton said We used to be the younger generation but we 've become senior players ourselves Clinton 's level of fitness is also at an all time high , the off season training trimming Clinton down from 115 kg to 108 kg I 've never been this fit , Joel said I'm feeling unreal Elliot commented that \( Joel 's \) training has been nothing short of phenomenal and I'm expecting his performances to follow Round Opposition Runs Metres Gained Tackles Tries Win Loss Round 1 , Cronulla 10 81 30 0 Loss

Cronulla Sharks in Round 1 down to the change of coach Me and most of the other guys have only known one way for the past five years , Clinton said We 've got to start to have belief You 've just got to back yourself , me and the boys If we do that , we 'll shake up the comp I know it 's early days to say that , but I think we should go pretty well After the Panthers win over the Bulldogs in Round 2 , sports journalists were commenting on how important Joel Clinton was to the effort He 'd primed himself to match the muscle of Canterbury 's Mark O'Meley and Willie Mason and produced as good a performance as he 's given since 2003 , when he made the Australian squad as a young prop In Round 4 , in response to Scott Prince complaining about off the ball play , Joel Clinton was interviewed for his personal view on dirty tricks in the NRL If stuff happens on the field you leave it on the field I never take anything off the field I do n't like to go home and whinge about it In Round 5 , Joel Clinton was criticised for the amount of penalties he conceded in the game , and season generally However , Clinton continues to top the work rates in the Panthers side Clinton is still eager to do more , as Peter Sterling \( Channel 9 commentator \) noted , Clinton appears to be under utilised by the Panthers , often building up a head of steam before being cut out by a skip pass Sterling noted that exploiting Clinton 's offense is crucial to 2007 success for the Panthers In Round 7 , the Panthers lost to the Canberra Raiders Clinton said he was disgusted with the team 's performance During the week , a virus spread through the team , affecting Clinton , Luke Priddis , Frank Puletua , Nathan Smith and Craig Gower who was hospitalised Despite the virus , Clinton thought it was n't an excuse for the loss There were a couple of crook boys but that 's something you just have to deal with , Clinton said 'That Try' In Round 9 the Panthers broke their five match losing streak against the Cowboys , despite the early loss of halfback play maker Craig Gower Clinton also broke his season long try scoring drought Solely chasing a mediocre kick , the bounce of the ball confused Cowboys winger Brenton Bowen , allowing Joel to gather and score in the corner The try pushed momentum in favour of the second from the bottom Panthers and pushed second placed Cowboys into despair Clinton 's performance in the game earned him the status of a stand out player of Round 9 Clinton 's effort was one of the few spectacular things to happen in a scrappy game , his athletic pick up on the fly from a Peter Wallace kick belying the fact he is a front row forward and one of the biggest players in the NRL 2008 Move to the Broncos Joel Clinton came off contract in 2008 Panthers rhetoric had suggested he would not be renewed at his current salary Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett then met with Clinton in Sydney in May 2007 , spiking speculation whether Clinton would join the Broncos for 2008 Negotiations with the Panthers began , with Clinton being offered a three year contract with both the Panthers and Broncos On 1 June 2007 , it was confirmed that Clinton had signed to the Brisbane Broncos for the 2008 NRL season There , he is expected to fill the big shoes of retired Shane Webcke Personal life Hobbies Joel began golfing when fellow Panther Craig Gower invited him out for a round Ever since , Joel has enjoyed golf , playing two rounds most weeks , and now averages 73 over 18 holes Joel describes golf as very relaxing , and a chance to get away from everything Clinton has entered numerous Pro am events in Australia , and recalls his favourite golfing moment as when I won the longest drive by an amateur I won a TV for that , plus my drive was only just short of the pro who won the overall longest drive Clinton also recounts his worse golfing moment as when there was a competition for the closest to the pin where the winner got a holiday The Channel Nine Footy Show team and about two thousand people were there and my shot went just five metres Joel 's other hobbies include water skiing , snow boarding , and fishing BMX Bandit During their 2003 premiership winning season , Clinton lived with fellow Panther Ben Ross The two were well known for cycling to training sessions and most local destinations We have a race to training most of the time , Ross stated I always win , added Clinton In one incident , Clinton rolled down a set of stairs , tried to brake the wrong brakes at the front locked up his wheels and sent bicycle and 114 kilograms of first grade footballer through a video store window , to the shock and bemusement of the customers Tattoos After winning the 2003 NRL Premiership , Joel Clinton got a tattoo of a giant snarling
