The Dictators are a garage rock band formed in New York City in 1973 Critic John Dougan said that they were one of the finest and most influential proto punk bands to walk the earth allmusic \( \( \( The Dictators Biography \) \) \) The Dictators are represented in the Punk Wing of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , in Cleveland , Ohio Steven Van Zandt called them The connective tissue between the eras of The MC5 , Stooges , NY Dolls , and the punk explosion of the mid to late 1970 's Epic Origins The original recording line up consisted of bassist vocalist Andy Adny Shernoff , lead guitarist Ross The Boss Friedman \( aka Ross Funicello \) , rhythm guitarist Scott Top Ten Kempner , and drummer Stu Boy King \( who was , in fact , the band 's fourth drummer since forming in 1973 \) It was this line up along with roadie occasional vocalist and Secret Weapon Handsome Dick Manitoba which recorded the band 's 1975 debut album , The Dictators Go Girl Crazy for Epic Records , produced by Sandy Pearlman and Murray Krugman \( best known for their work with Blue yster Cult \) Although the album sold poorly at the time , today it is considered one of the most important albums ever recorded by a New York punk band of the period , and still stands as arguably one of the funniest records ever made Frustrated by the lack of sales , the band broke up for a few months in late 1975 , but reconvened in early 1976 , with bassist Mark The Animal Mendoza replacing Shernoff After a few months Shernoff was persuaded to return to the group as the group 's keyboardist This line up soon secured a contract with Asylum Records \( at least partly due to the notoriety the group had developed following a well publicized brawl between Manitoba and Wayne County \) Jaynecounty com and released their second album , Manifest Destiny , in 1977 The album again produced by Pearlman and Krugman is usually considered the weakest of the group 's first three albums , and featured a considerably more mainstream sound The band resisted playing songs from Manifest Destiny for several years because the album had not been re released on CD During this period the band was christened with their nickname , The 'Taters This culminated in an incident during a tour with Uriah Heep and Foreigner in which Foreigner 's roadies strung a net filled with potatoes above the stage and released it during the Dictators' set By 1978 Mendoza had left the band \( he soon joined Twisted Sister \) and Shernoff had returned to his original position on bass guitar It was this line up of Manitoba , Shernoff , Friedman , Kempner , and Rich Teeter which recorded Bloodbrothers \( yet again produced by Pearlman and Krugman \) It was the first album to feature Manitoba as the group 's vocalist on all the songs , though Bruce Springsteen a big fan of the group to this day can be heard counting 1 2 1 2 3 4 during the album 's opening track , Faster and Louder The album 's Baby , Let 's Twist was a minor hit on a number of east coast radio stations , but the lack of mainstream success caused the band to split the following year Shortly before the split drummer Mel Anderson had left Twisted Sister and joined The Dictators , replacing Teeter 1980s After the break up , Manitoba drove a cab , Shernoff worked as a producer , and Friedman became something of a gun for hire working first with the French hard rock band Shakin' Street , then becoming a founding member of Manowar in 1982 , and producing the first demo for Anthrax Although Friedman had spoken to the press with some bitterness about The Dictators during the early Manowar period , he and the other members of the band began reuniting occasionally in 1981 , and later that year ROIR released the cassette only Fuck 'Em If They Ca n't Take a Joke , which featured numbers from all three of the group 's studio albums , covers of the Velvet Underground 's What Goes On and Mott the Hoople 's Moon Upstairs , and two new Shernoff numbers Loyola and New York New York Other than occasional reunion shows , little was heard from The Dictators during the next five years However , in late 1986 Shernoff and Manitoba \( along with guitarist Daniel Rey \) formed Wild Kingdom , releasing a version of New York New York on the 1988 soundtrack to Mondo New York 1990s By the time of Wild Kingdom 's 1990 MCA Records debut , And You \? \( by which time they were now billed as Manitoba 's Wild Kingdom \) , Rey had left the group and had been replaced by Friedman , making it for all practical purposes the fourth Dictators album \( the group was rounded out by drummer J P Patterson \) And You \? clocking in at a whopping 25 minutes in length received excellent reviews , with Rolling Stone calling it the first great punk rock album of the '90s Following a club tour that year Kempner \( who had been previously occupied by his work with the Del Lords during much of the 1980s \) joined the group and Manitoba 's Wild Kingdom was replaced by The Dictators The And You \? album cover was a source of some controversy at the time since it was lifted from a Nazi recruiting poster dating back to World War II It was not the first time members of the band \( most of whom , ironically , were Jewish \) had been associated with charges of this sort since Go Girl Crazy had featured the songs Master Race Rock and Back to Africa By the 1990s much about the lives of the band 's members had changed markedly Shernoff recorded and toured with The Fleshtones in 1989 and 1990 , became a wine expert , and wrote with Joey Ramone Manitoba opened a successful East Village bar called Manitoba 's in 1999 Kempner had developed a certain degree of respect from roots rock audiences due to his 1980s work with The Del Lords In 1992 he released his highly acclaimed solo album Tenement Angels and joined The Brandos in 1993 Friedman 's work with Manowar and Brain Surgeons had given him a certain cachet with heavy metal audiences However , the group first with Frank Funaro on drums , then again with Patterson began recording a fourth Dictators album in the late 1990s , which was eventually released as D F F D in 2001 The album was well received , and a couple of the songs particularly Who Will Save Rock 'n' Roll and I Am Right should be regarded as legitimate classics of the band 's catalog However , Shernoff has remarked that it will probably be the group 's final studio album of new material since he finds writing rock songs to be more difficult as time goes on 2000s Manitoba currently sings lead vocals with the surviving members of the MC5 , and is a Sirius Satellite Radio DJ on Little Steven 's Underground Garage channel Following Kempner 's move to California in 2002 and his departure from the group , The Dictators continue to perform to a devoted audience , and released a new live album , VIVA Dictators \( with Kempner on rhythm guitar \) in 2005 The Dictators compiled an album of demos , rarities , and unreleased songs recorded at various times over their thirty plus year career , released by Norton Records in 2007 as Every Day Is Saturday In November 2007 , Manitoba , along with author Amy Wallace , put out The Official Punk Rock Book of Lists on BackBeat Books , a small book company owned by Hal Leonard Publishing In July 2008 , Kempner released his well received 2nd solo album Saving Grace He is in the process of assembling a band for some summer dates Weblogs com In October 2008 , The Dictators reunited for a series of concerts in Spain 1 October at Apolo 2 in Barcelona 2 October in Alicante 3 October in Madrid and finally 4 October in Bilbao References Discography The Dictators Go Girl Crazy ! \( 1975 \) Manifest Destiny \( 1977 \) Bloodbrothers \( 1978 \) Fuck 'Em If They Ca n't Take a Joke \( 1981 \) The Dictators Live , New York , New York \( 1998 \) D F F D \( 2001 \) Viva Dictators \( 2005 \) Every Day Is Saturday \( 2007 \) External links http www thedictators com At CBGB Interview with The Dictators by TruePunk com Ross The Boss' Official Web Site Scott Kempner 's MySpace Page Interview with Andy Shernoff on Food Is Not Love Kempner 7 08 Variety interview Dictators , The Dictators , The de The Dictators es The Dictators fr The Dictators it The Dictators no The Dictators pt The Dictators fi The Dictators sv The Dictators
