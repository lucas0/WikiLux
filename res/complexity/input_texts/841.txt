Smith as Bobby Tory as Andre , based on the real seal Andre the Seal Jay Brazeau as Griff Armstrong Production The film is based on the book A Seal Called Andre , co written by the seal 's owner , Harry Goodridge , and Lew Dietz , which describes the true story of Andre The location , approximate dates , first names , ages and occupations of the real family members are all preserved , although two of the Goodridge children , Carol and Susan , are not depicted in the film Andre really did perform tricks for people down at the harbour , becoming a celebrity He was free to come and go from the home to the sea as he pleased , though he had a floating pound and an old bathtub in the family 's barn Billy Baker is a composite character , drawing together a minority of fishermen who used seals as scapegoats for poor catches The book tells of one such fisherman , named only as he within the text , who became angry with Andre , and who wanted to shoot him , but was quickly talked out of it Andre really was nursed with an artificial mother , of the kind depicted in the film , and he did go missing in his first winter , returning in the spring The storm scene appears to have been added for cinematic and plot reasons , as do many of the subplots and supporting characters The case really was investigated by the federals in conjunction with a law which prohibited the keeping of wild animals but this happened later in Andre 's life than the film depicts , and the case was quickly dropped on the grounds that Andre had been kept before the law came into play that is , it was demonstrably his own intention to come home and to remain with the family During the closing credits , shots from original 16mm films of the real Andre are shown He , who spent every winter in the New England Aquarium in Boston , entertained tourists in Rockport every summer , having swum up there upon his release each spring , until his death in the spring of 1986 Andre the celebrity seal dies ,
