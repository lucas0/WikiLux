The Higher Education Academy \( HEA \) is a British professional membership scheme promoting excellence in higher education The HEA advocates evidence based teaching methods and awards fellowships as a method of professional recognition for university teachers The HEA was responsible for the UK Professional Standards Framework for higher education practitioners On 21 March 2018 , the HEA merged with the Leadership Foundation and the Equality Challenge Unit to form Advance HE Advance HE https www advance he ac uk questions answers Accessed 18 June 2018 The HEA had premises in York Science Park , Heslington Its work is continued by Advance HE , which now operates the Higher Education Academy 's professional membership scheme History and formation The history of teacher training in the United Kingdom is a complex subject In 1946 , faced with chronic personnel shortages after the 2nd World War , the government invested in training programmes and required all teachers in the state sector to acquire qualified teacher status For the next half century , Universities responded to this policy by providing both graduate entrants into teaching and teacher training programmes In recent decades however , there has been a shift towards school based training for teaching and also a change in terminology as teacher education has displaced teacher training Despite Higher Education 's involvement in teacher training , University Lecturers have not needed any formal qualifications beyond demonstrating , usually through publications and a higher degree \( such as a doctorate \) , expert subject knowledge The merits of professional teaching qualifications for University Lecturers became an issue for debate during the later twentieth century In 1997 , the Dearing Report recommended the establishment of a professional body for Lecturers , the Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education , that would define standards and accredit training for university teaching In a further recommendation , the Dearing Report suggested that during their probationary periods , all new Lecturers should be required to achieve 'at least associate membership' of the new Institute In response , the Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education was founded in 2000 In January 2003 , a committee established by HEFCE , Universities UK and the Standing Conference of Principals recommended the establishment of a single central body responsible for standards of teaching in higher education In response , the Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education was merged with the Learning and Teaching Support Network and the National Coordination Team for the Teaching Quality Enhancement Fund , becoming the Higher Education Academy Aims and purpose The HEA stated its overall aim in the following words The HEA devised a particular set of standards for university teaching \( the 'UK Professional Standards Framework' \) , conferring professional recognition on academics who have met these standards , and runs the UK 's annual National Teaching Fellowship awards It also provides many online resources , some discipline specific and some more generic , and organises workshops , seminars and journals on matters of interest The HEA has a 'policy think tank' and is engaged in research into teaching and learning , e g exploring the applicability of 'grade point average' schemes to the UK UK Professional Standards Framework \( UKPSF \) The UK Professional Standards Framework \( UKPSF \) for teaching and supporting learning in higher education is a voluntary scheme for describing the competences and values expected of university teaching staff in the UK The scheme consists of four 'descriptors' , corresponding to different roles in higher education , and defines the areas of activity , core knowledge and professional values expected at each level UKPSF was developed by the HEA and UKPSF 's descriptors correspond to the levels in HEA 's professional recognition scheme The introduction of national professional standards for university teachers was one of the higher education reforms proposed in the 2003 DfES white paper The Future of Higher Education This paper outlined government plans to introduce new standards and to ensure that all new university teaching staff achieved a qualification that met them These would be the responsibility of a new single centre of excellence in the form of a teaching quality academy In response to this , the HEA was formed , and commissioned by the UK 's education funding councils and Universities UK to develop the new standards These became known as the UK Professional Standards Framework or UKPSF The framework has two elements the descriptors which describe higher education roles and the associated competences , and the dimensions of practice which describe the activities , core knowledge and professional values expected of practitioners There are four descriptors corresponding to support staff with minor teaching duties , full academics \( e g lecturers \) , senior academics with teaching specialisms , and senior management with strategic responsibility for teaching The descriptors correspond to the four grades within the HEA 's professional recognition scheme and academic staff are usually expected to demonstrate that they meet the second descriptor during their probationary period The framework is used to accredit training schemes for university teachers such as the Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education \( PGCHE \) and the Postgraduate Certificate in Academic Practice Fellowships of the HEA and professional recognition The HEA operated a professional recognition scheme \( now run by Advance HE \) for university teachers who have demonstrated that their teaching practices are well aligned with UKPSF This is intended both to encourage excellence in teaching and to provide academics with a portable qualification transferable between institutions There are four grades AFHEA Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy FHEA Fellow of the Higher Education Academy SFHEA Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy PFHEA Principal Fellow of the Higher Education Academy The Associate Fellow grade represents the minimum level of competence expected of any university teacher , with the Fellow grade representing the level normally required in an established academic post These grades can be awarded on the basis of an assessed portfolio \( containing a candidate 's statement and supporting references \) or on completion of an accredited course such as a PGCHE or PGCAP The higher grades of Senior Fellow and Principal Fellow represent significant leadership in the promotion of teaching excellence , and are only awarded on the basis of an assessed portfolio Funding The Higher Education Academy was funded by grants from four higher education funding bodies in the UK \( HEFCE , SFC , HEFCW and DELNI \) , subscriptions from higher education institutions , and grant contract income for organised initiatives It is owned by the representative bodies of the higher education sector Universities UK and GuildHE \( formerly known as the Standing Conference of Principals \) Historical activities HEA used to incorporate subject centres to share best practices in specific disciplines These centres were based around the UK at relevant university faculties As of 1 January 2012 , the subject centres have closed Archived resources that have been developed over their 12 years will still be available in the discipline pages of the HEA website List of former Higher Education Academy Subject Centres Art , Design and Media Bioscience Built Environment Business Management
