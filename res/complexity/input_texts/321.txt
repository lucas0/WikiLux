The majority of Egyptologists agree on the outline and many details of the chronology of Ancient Egypt This scholarly consensus is the so called Conventional Egyptian chronology , which places the beginning of the Old Kingdom in ca the 27th century BC and the beginning of the Middle Kingdom in the 21st century BC There are , however , bona fide disagreements within the scholary community , resulting in variant chronologies diverging by about three hundred years for the Early Dynastic Period , up to thirty years in the New Kingdom , and a few years in the Late Period In addition , there is a number of alternative chronologies outside of scholarly consensus , such as the New Chronology proposed in the 1990s which lowers New Kingdom dates by as much as 350 years , or the Glasgow Chronology \( proposed 1978 1982 \) which lowers New Kingdom dates by as much as 500 years Overview Scholarly consensus on the general outline of the conventional chronology current in Egyptology has not fluctuated much over the last 100 years For the Old Kingdom , consensus fluctuates by as much as a few centuries , but for the Middle and New Kindoms , it has been stable to within a few decades This is illustrated by comparing the chronology as given by two Egyptologists , the first writing in 1906 , the second in 2000 \( all dates in the table are BC \) Breasted 's dates are taken from his Ancient Records \( first published in 1906 \) , volume 1 , sections 58 75 Shaw 's are from his Oxford History of Ancient Egypt \( published in 2000 \) , pp 479 483 dynasty Breasted \( 1906 \) Shaw \(

understanding of the still very incomplete source evidence For example , Breasted adds a ruler in the Twentieth dynasty that further research showed did not exist Following Manetho , Breasted also believed all the dynasties were sequential , whereas it is now known that several existed at the same time These revisions have resulted in a shortening of the conventional chronology by up to 400 years at the beginning of Dynasty I Regnal years The backbone of Egyptian chronology are the regnal years as recorded in Ancient Egyptian king lists As these lists exhibit often have significant gaps in their text \( for example , the Turin King List \) , or while textually complete but fail to provide a complete list of rulers , the compilation of a full list of pharaohs complete with regnal years is a tedious task It is further complicated by occasional conflicting information on the same regnal period from different versions of the same text thus , the Egyptian historian Manetho 's history of Egypt is only known by extensive references to it made by subsequent writers , such as Eusebius and Sextus Julius Africanus and the dates for the same pharaoh often vary substantially depending on the intermediate source Regnal periods have to be pieced together from inscriptions , which will often give a date in the form of the regnal year of the ruling pharaoh , which will only ascertain a minimum reign length and may or may not include any coregencies with a predecessor or successor In addition , some Egyptian dynasties may have overlapped , with different pharaohs ruling in different regions at the same time , rather than serially Not knowing whether monarchies were simultaneous or sequential may lead to widely differing chronological interpretations In the early days of Egyptology , the compilation of regnal periods may also have been hampered due to Biblical bias on the part of the Egyptologists This was most pervasive before the mid 19th century , when Manetho 's figures were recognized as conflicting with Biblical chronology based on Old Testament references to Egypt \( see Pharaohs in the Bible \) In the 20th century , such Biblical bias has mostly been confined to alternative chronologies outside of scholarly mainstream Synchronisms A useful way to work around these gaps in knowledge is to find chronological synchronisms Over the past decades a number of these have been found , of varying degrees of usefulness and reliability Synchronisms with other chronologies , the most important of these being with the Assyrian and Babylonian chronologies , although synchronisms with the Hittites , ancient Palestine , and in the final period with ancient Greece are also used The earliest such synchronisms appear in the 15th century BC , during the Amarna Period , when we have a considerable quantity of diplomatic correspondence between the Egyptian Kings Amenhotep III and Akhenaten , and various Near Eastern monarchs \( See Chronology of the Ancient Near East \) Synchronisms with inscriptions relating to the burial of Apis bulls begin as early as the reign of Amenhotep III and continue into Ptolemaic times , but there is a significant gap in the record between Ramesses XI and the 23rd year of Osorkon II The poor documentation of these finds in the Serapeum also compounds the difficulties in using these records Astronomical synchronisms The best known of these is the Sothic cycle , and careful study of this led Richard A Parker to argue that the dates of the Twelfth dynasty could be fixed with absolute precision Set forth in Excursus C The Twelfth dynasty in his The Calendars of ancient Egypt \( Chicago University Press , 1950 \) More recent research has eroded this confidence , questioning many of the assumptions used with the Sothic Cycle , and as a result experts have moved away from relying on this Cycle One example is Patrick O'Mara , Censorinus , the Sothic Cycle , and calendar year one in ancient Egypt the Epistological problem , Journal of Near Eastern studies , 62 \( 2003 \) , pp 17 26 For example , Donald B Redford , in attempting to fix the date of the end of the Eighteenth dynasty , almost completely ignores the Sothic evidence , relying on synchronicities between Egypt and Assyria \( by way of the Hittites \) , and help from astronomical observations Redford , The Dates of the End of the 18th Dynasty , History and Chronology of the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt Seven studies \( Toronto University Press , 1967 \) , pp 183 215 Kate Spence , Ancient Egyptian chronology and the astronomical orientation of pyramids , Nature , 408 \( 2000 \) , pp 320 324 She offers , based on orientation of the Great Pyramid of Giza with circumpolar stars , for a date of that structure precise within 5 years Radiocarbon dating This is useful especially for the Early Dynastic period , where Egyptological consensus has only been possible within a range of about three or four centuries A 2013 study found a First Dynasty start in the 32nd or 31st century , compatible with scholarly opinions placing it in between the 34th and 30th centuries The Thera eruption This is a famous conundrum not just in Egyptian but also in Aegean \( Minoan \) chronology , as the radiocarbon date for the eruption , between 1627 and 1600 BC \( p 5 \) , is off by a full century compared to the date traditionally accepted in archaeology of c 1500 BC The date of this volcanic event is of critical importance to the synchronisations of the civilisations in the Eastern Mediterranean The solution of this matter is the key to most of our synchronisation problems Bibliotheca Orientalis 61 , 1 2 January April 2004 Book review of W Manning 's A Test of Time , 1999 , Oxbow Books Since 2012 , there have been suggestions that the solution lies in adjustment of both dates towards a compromise date in the mid 16th century BC , In 2012 one of the proponents of an archaeological date , Felix H flmayer , argued that archaeological evidence could be consistent with a date as early as 1570 BCE , reducing the discrepancy to around fifty years Conversely , the radiocarbon dates have been argued to be inaccurate by Malcolm Wiener , Radiocarbon dating of the Theran eruption , Open Journal of Archaeometry , 2 \( 2014 \) DOI 10 4081 arc 2014 5265 but as of 2014 the problem has not been satisfactorily resolved Dendrochronology There have been occasional opportunities to use dendrochronology to support Egyptian chronology , mostly for the New Kingdom period , e g the Uluburun shipwreck Kuniholm et al Nature 1996 , 782 Combined use of dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating allowed identification of tree rings even back to the Middle Kingdom period , as in the coffin of Ipi ha ishutef \( dated 2073 9 BC \) or the funerary boat of Senusret III \( dated 1887 11 BC conventional reign date 1878 BC 1839 BC \) S Manning et al , 'High precision dendro 14C dating of two cedar

chronologies A number of suggestions for alternatives to the consensus on the conventional chronology have been presented during the 20th century The Revised Chronology of Immanuel Velikovsky as
