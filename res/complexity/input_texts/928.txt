The Circular Congregational Church is a historic church at 150 Meeting Street in Charleston , South Carolina , United States , used by a congregation established in 1681 Its parish house , the Parish House of the Circular Congregational Church , is a highly significant Greek Revival architectural work by Robert Mills , and is recognized as a U S National Historic Landmark Colonial origins of the church left thumb Circular Church The congregation was co founded with Charles Towne , 1680 1685 , by the English Congregationalists , Scots Presbyterians , and French Huguenots of the original settlement These dissenters erected a Meeting House in the northwest corner of the walled city The present sanctuary occupies that exact site The street leading to it was called Meeting House Street , later shortened to Meeting Street The earliest records of the church were lost when a hurricane swept them from the manse , located at White Point \( the Battery \) , in 1713 During the colonial period , this unusual church had no official name , but suffered itself to be called either Presbyterian , Congregational , or Independent sometimes by one of the names , sometimes by two of them , and at other times by all three We do not find that this church is either Presbyterian , Congregational , or Independent , but somewhat distinct and singular from them all Church records , February 5 , 1775 Many of the early ministers hailed from Scotland , England , Wales , and New England The old White Meeting House was enlarged in 1732 , only a year after 12 Scots families moved down the street to start the First \( Scots \) Presbyterian Church with a stricter Presbyterian government and doctrine While many Presbyterians remained , the policy of this church was not so much to define exactly a particular mode of their discipline , and to bind their hands up to any one stiff form adopted either by Presbyterians , Congregationalists , or Independents , as to be upon a broad dissenting bottom , and to leave ourselves as free as possible from any foreign shackles , that no moderate persons of either denomination might be afraid to join them Shaped by its independent mind and goaded by a colonial government that treated dissenters \( non Anglicans \) with contempt , the church became a greenhouse for revolutionary sentiment in the colony Prominent members of the Meeting House , and its distinguished minister , William Tennent \( 1772 1777 \) , were frequently heard speaking for political and religious freedom Tennent took his life in his hands when he made a wide tour of the Carolina back country in 1775 to gain subscribers for the cause of independence The Archdale Street Meeting House separated in 1817 as the Second Independent Church , and later it adopted the name Unitarian The congregation of Circular Church remained trinitarian under the pastoral leadership of the Rev Benjamin Morgan Palmer \( 1813 1835 \) Noteworthy is the fact that Palmer was a special son of this church , born in Philadelphia just two weeks after his parents had been driven into exile there in 1781 The Church in exile When the British captured Charleston in 1780 , this church was bitterly rewarded for its love of freedom by the illegal exile of 38 heads of families to St Augustine \( in Spanish territory \) and then to Philadelphia Their families were left destitute in an occupied city The Meeting House , vacant since the cannonball episode , was used as a British hospital and left a shell In 1782 the church in exile held a congregational meeting in Philadelphia where they made arrangements to call a minister to Charleston as soon as may be feasible \( Tennent had died in 1777 \) Members remaining in Charleston began the week of British evacuation to rebuild the Meeting House By 1787 , the congregation had built a second meeting house on Archdale Street to accommodate their growing number For 25 years , Drs Hollinshead and Keith , co pastors of the church , preached one sermon in both houses each Sunday , alternating morning and afternoon services Robert Mills' Extraordinary Building thumb left 200px The portico and steeple base of the Circular Church were photographed in 1860 thumbnail right 200px The steeple of Mills' design is seen in this June 1857 image from Harper 's In 1804 , the time had come to replace the Meeting Street house with a more commodious building Martha Laurens Ramsay proposed a circular form and Robert Mills , Charleston 's leading architect who also designed the Washington Monument in D C , completed the plans The church he designed was a Pantheon type building in diameter with seven great doors and 26 windows On its main floor and in the gallery it was said to accommodate 2 , 000 worshippers The first major domed building in North America , it was described by one observer in 1818 as the most extraordinary building in the United States However , people made fun of the fact that the church lacked a steeple and for years laughed at the rhyme The people of Circular Church , as it was now popularly called , stopped the laughter in 1838 by raising a New England style steeple that towered above Meeting Street From glory to destruction thumb right 200px Photographed in 1865 , the ruins of the Circular Church still showed the clear circular layout of the building designed by Robert Mills During the glory days of 1820 1860 , Circular Church had a large congregation of white and black members The first Sunday School for religious education in South Carolina was started here in 1816 , and members founded the Charleston Bible Society , a prototype to the later American Bible Society The membership included two governors of the state , prominent senators , the editor of the Courier , and many others whose voices made Charleston eloquent and who extended the influence of their church far beyond its walls It also included many slaves and poor whose names were unknown to anyone beyond its walls The walls of the Circular Church were not long to stand On December 11 , 1861 , a fire started near the Cooper River During the night , a hurricane of fire swept all the way across the city , leaving in its wake the ruins of Old Circular The American Civil War soon followed with its devastating effect The black members of the church withdrew in 1867 to form the Plymouth Congregational Church The psychology of defeat continued to demoralize the church for more than a decade , and it was a chastened and much reduced congregation that gathered the brick from the overgrown ruins of the great 1804 meeting house and erected a new sanctuary in 1890 In January 1888 , the congregation began the process of removing the materials from the old church From independence to interdependence thumb upright

\( its successor \) in 1954 , and Atlantic Presbytery of the United Presbyterian Church \( U S A \) in 1968 It is one of the few congregation in the South that expresses its ecumenical commitment by belonging to two denominations , the U C C and the Presbyterian Church The church follows Jesus Christ in the radical way of progressive Christianity Followers believe the Bible is truthful but not literal , that God is a living Presence but not a dominating white man in the sky , that Jesus is a person of the Spirit and of saving wisdom but not a sacrifice to an offended God Circular Church is aware of the needs of people on the margins of society The church has founded the city 's first marriage and family counseling center , Charleston 's crisis intervention service \( Hotline \) , Hospice of Charleston , and the Elder Shelter Space and leadership have been provided to the Charleston Interfaith Crisis Ministry , Amnesty International , Alcoholics Anonymous , Narcotics Anonymous
