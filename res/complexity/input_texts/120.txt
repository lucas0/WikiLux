Aztlan is mentioned in several ethnohistorical sources dating from the colonial period , and each of them give different lists of the different tribal groups who participated in the migration from Aztlan to central Mexico , but the Mexica who went on to found Mexico Tenochtitlan are mentioned in all of the accounts Historians have speculated about the possible location of Aztlan and tend to place it either in northwestern Mexico or the southwest US , although there are doubts about whether the place is purely mythical or represents a historical reality Legend Nahuatl legends relate that seven tribes lived in Chicomoztoc , or the place of the seven caves Each cave represented a different Nahua group the Xochimilca , Tlahuica , Acolhua , Tlaxcalteca , Tepaneca , Chalca , and Aztec Because of their common linguistic origin , those groups are called collectively Nahuatlaca \( Nahua people \) These tribes subsequently left the caves and settled near Aztl n The various descriptions of Aztl n apparently contradict each other While some legends describe Aztl n as a paradise , the Codex Aubin says that the Aztecs were subject to a tyrannical elite called the Azteca Chicomoztoca
