Elizabeth Coles Langhorne and Nancy Hale Bowers founded VCCA in 1971 Hale Bowers , the first female reporter for The New York Times and a frequent 'New Yorker ' contributor , testified before the Virginia Commission for the Arts and the Humanities that if Virginia really wanted to further the arts , it could do so easily , moreover cheaply , by purchasing an abandoned motel and staffing it for writers to write in feeding them and seeing that they were uninterrupted http www newmusicbox org page nmbx \? id 47tp03 The remark resonated with Langhorne , but her 1968 residency at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire suggested a considerably more elegant approach She and Hale Bowers collaborated with Maria Miller and Edith Newcomb who donated the use of her Wavertree Farm , near Charlottesville , Virginia Included on the original board were William Massey Smith , Alex von Thelen , Peter Taylor , and MacDowell Colony s longtime Director , George Kendall The first sixteen Fellows arrived in June 1971 , and the first international Fellows arrived from the UK and Korea the following year Repeated dislocations marked the early years of the VCCA In 1973 Edith Newcomb s daughters reclaimed Wavertree Farm , but in 1974 Rosamund Frost Lowell donated the use of historic Prospect Hill estate east of Charlottesville That year VCCA received its first challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Arts Expansion restrictions imposed by the National Register of Historic Places would convince the VCCA Board to close Prospect Hill Then , the VCCA executive directorship was awarded to Bill Smart , a VCCA Fellow and a professor at Sweet Briar College near Amherst , who would direct VCCA for several decades Langhorne urged Smart to arrange two VCCA residency sessions with Sweet Briar College in 1976 , which led to a 25 year lease of Sweet Briar 's nearby 450 acre Mount San Angelo estate in 1976 , an agreement made by Sweet Briar President Harold Whiteman and VCCA Board President Jane Camp VCCA become the only artists community in America directly affiliated with an institution of higher learning In time , the lease was expanded to automatic 15 year options VCCA Fellows periodically teach at Sweet Briar and benefit from its academic , cultural and athletic facilities Mount San Angelo is an estate in Central Virginia that includes a villa

communities with a studio center overseas The seed of VCCA France was planted by Alain and Lucy Delsol in 1994Bergman , Eric , A Brief History of the CECA and the Moulin Nef , La Gazette du Moulin Nef 1 i 2001 when they invited a group of Denver , Colorado artists to spend two weeks working in the picturesque village of Auvillar , http www auvillar fr en on the Garonne between Toulouse and Bordeaux Some artists stayed with families others had both their lodgings and their studio at the village s Maison Vielhezcases , named for the theatre director who once owned it The visit was such a success that it became the yearly Auvill art tradition , attracting attention and funding from the Donnell Kay Foundation In 1999 the Foundation bought land , including three decrepit buildings and an overgrown vineyard , in Auvillar s old port neighborhood The property was dubbed the Moulin Nef or floating mill Such mills , which Procopius says were first used by the Romans to maintain flour production during a land siege , had swarmed European rivers such as the Garonne for many centuries Altivilaris , as Auvillar was known in the earliest 11th century references , was a hub for commercial waterway shipping , and this helped the village to gain renown during the 18th and 19th centuries for its faience , tin glazed earthenware that simulated Chinese porcelain The largest of the Foundation s three buildings , destined to contain a ceramics atelier and several other studios , was called La Ceba after La ceba d Aoubila , the trademark floral motif of the old Auvillar faience makers A second building , containing offices and library , was called La Cloucado do Molin after La Cloucado Marcabrun , the Occitan literary clique founded by Fr d ric Mistral and friends seven f libres , latter day troubadours , who inaugurated Auvillar s yearly festival of Saint No as part of their homage to their native Gascony In 2000 , having received permits to restore the Ceba and the Cloucado , the Foundation launched the Cultural Exchange Center of Auvillar \( CECA \) , an American nonprofit chartered to finish construction , establish pilot programs , interact with American contacts , and find an appropriate institution to own and run the Moulin Nef In 2001 came the Association Auvill art \( AAA \) , a French nonprofit to interact with French contacts The Auvillar building crews proceeded so rapidly that by June 2001 the architect , Didier M dale , could conduct the final inspection of both the Ceba and the Cloucado During the next three years the Moulin Nef s exchanges came to include not only painting , drawing , sculpture , ceramics , literature , drama and musical composition but also filmmaking , a film festival , folk and ballet dancing , calligraphy , handicrafts , digital photography and gastronomy There were adult and youth exchange programs with a number of educational institutions Early in 2003 the Foundation sent out a circular to interested organizations it deemed candidates to inherit the Moulin Nef The following April , the choice of VCCA was announced , and VCCA Fellows first appeared in Auvillar in June 2004 , guided by VCCA Director of Artist Services Sheila Gulley Pleasants and her husband , Program Director Craig Pleasants Ownership of the Moulin Nef was formally transferred to VCCA on 29 December 2004 the formation of the French nonprofit VCCA France in 2007 made it an autonomous satellite of VCCA Its current Resident Director is Cheryl Fortier By the summer of 2010 , 86 Fellows had completed their residencies , and collaboration with academic institutions such as Yale s Institute of Studio Studies was intensifying VCCA s French connection became even firmer when VCCA Advisory Council Member Cy Twombly became the first American invited to do a permanent installation at the Louvre , painting the ceiling of the Salle des Bronzes with the assistance of VCCA Fellow Barbara Crawford http www
